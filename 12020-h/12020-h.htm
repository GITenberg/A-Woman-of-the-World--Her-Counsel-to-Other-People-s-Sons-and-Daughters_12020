<h2>To Mr. Ray Gilbert</h2>
<p class="c3">Late Student, Aged Twenty-three<br>
<p>Were you an older man, my dear Ray, your letter would be
consigned to the flames unanswered, and our friendship would become
constrained and formal, if it did not end utterly. But knowing you
to be so many years my junior, and so slightly acquainted with
yourself or womankind, I am going to be the friend you need,
instead of the misfortune you invite.
<p>I will not say that your letter was a complete surprise to me.
It is seldom a woman is so unsophisticated in the ways of men that
she is not aware when friendship passes the borderline and
trespasses on the domain of passion.
<p>I realized on the last two occasions we met that you were not
quite normal. The first was at Mrs. Hanover's dinner; and I
attributed some indiscreet words and actions on your part to the
very old Burgundy served to a very young man.
<p>Since the memory of mortal, Bacchus has been a confederate of
Cupid, and the victims of the former have a period (though brief
indeed) of believing themselves slaves to the latter.
<p>As I chanced to be your right-hand neighbour at that very merry
board, where wit, wisdom, and beauty combined to condense hours
into minutes, I considered it a mere accident that you gave
yourself to me with somewhat marked devotion. Had I been any other
one of the ladies present, it would have been the same, I thought.
Our next and last encounter, however, set me thinking.
<p>It was fully a week later, and that most unromantic portion of
the day, between breakfast and luncheon.
<p>It was a Bagby recital, and you sought me out as I was listening
to the music, and caused me to leave before the programme was half
done. You were no longer under the dominion of Bacchus, though
Euterpe may have taken his task upon herself, as she often does,
and your manner and expression of countenance troubled me.
<p>I happen to be a woman whose heart life is absolutely complete.
I have realized my dreams, and have no least desire to turn them
into nightmares. I like original r&ocirc;les, too, and that of the
really happy wife is less hackneyed than the part of the
"misunderstood woman." And I find greater enjoyment in the steady
flame of one lamp than in the flaring light of many candles.
<p>I have taken a good deal of pride in keeping my lamp well
trimmed and brightly burning, and I was startled and offended at
the idea of any man coming so near he imagined he might blow out
the light.
<p>Your letter, however, makes me more sorry than angry.
<p>You are passing through a phase of experience which comes to
almost every youth, between sixteen and twenty-four.
<p>Your affectional and romantic nature is blossoming out, and you
are in that transition period where an older woman appeals to you.
<p>Being crude and unformed yourself, the mature and ripened mind
and body attract you.
<p>A very young man is fascinated by an older woman's charms, just
as a very old man is drawn to a girl in her teens.
<p>This is according to the law of completion, each entity seeking
for what it does not possess.
<p>Ask any middle-aged man of your acquaintance to tell you the
years of the first woman he imagined he loved, and you will find
you are following a beaten path.
<p>Because you are a worth while young man, with a bright future
before you, I am, as I think of the matter, glad you selected me
rather than some other less happy or considerate woman, as the
object of your regard.
<p>An unhappy wife or an ambitious adventuress might mar your
future, and leave you with lowered ideals and blasted prospects.
<p>You tell me in your letter that for "a day of life and love with
me you would willingly give up the world and snap your fingers in
the face of conventional society, and even face death with a
laugh." It is easy for a passionate, romantic nature to work itself
into a mood where those words are felt when written, and sometimes
the mood carries a man and a woman through the fulfilment of such
assertions. But invariably afterward comes regret, remorse, and
disillusion.
<p>No man enjoys having the world take him at his word, when he
says he is ready to give it up for the woman he loves.
<p>He wants the woman and the world, too.
<p>In the long run, he finds the world's respect more necessary to
his continued happiness than the woman's society.
<p>Just recall the history of all such cases you have known, and
you will find my assertions true.
<p>Thank your stars that I am not a reckless woman ready to take
you at your word, and thank your stars, too, that I am not a free
woman who would be foolish enough and selfish enough to harness a
young husband to a mature wife. I know you resent this reference to
the difference in our years, which may not be so marked to the
observer to-day, but how would it be ten, fifteen years from now?
There are few disasters greater for husband or wife than the
marriage of a boy of twenty to a woman a dozen years his senior.
For when he reaches thirty-five, despair and misery must almost
inevitably face them both.
<p>You must forgive me when I tell you that one sentence in your
letter caused a broad smile.
<p>That sentence was, "Would to God I had met you when you were
free to be wooed and loved, as never man loved woman before."
<p>Now I have been married ten years, and you are twenty-three
years old! You must blame my imagination (not my heart, which has
no intention of being cruel) for the picture presented to my mind's
eye by your wish.
<p>I saw myself in the full flower of young ladyhood, carrying at
my side an awkward lad of a dozen years, attired in knickerbockers,
and probably chewing a taffy stick, yet "wooing and loving as never
man loved before."
<p>I suppose, however, the idea in your mind was that you wished
Fate had made me of your own age, and left me free for you.
<p>But few boys of twenty-three are capable of knowing what they
want in a life companion. Ten years from now your ideal will have
changed.
<p>You are in love with love, life, and all womankind, my dear boy,
not with me, your friend.
<p>Put away all such ideas, and settle down to hard study and
serious ambitions, and seal this letter of yours, which I am
returning with my reply, and lay it carefully away in some safe
place. Mark it to be destroyed unopened in case of your death. But
if you live, I want you to open, re-read and burn it on the evening
before your marriage to some lovely girl, who is probably rolling a
hoop to-day; and if I am living, I want you to write and thank me
for what I have said to you here. I hardly expect you will feel
like doing it now, but I can wait.
<p>Do not write me again until that time, and when we meet, be my
good sensible friend&mdash;one I can introduce to my husband, for only
such friends do I care to know.

<h2>To Miss Winifred Clayborne</h2>
<p class="c3">At Vassar College<br>
<p>My dear niece:&mdash;It was a pleasure to receive so long a letter
from you after almost two years of silence. It hardly seems
possible that you are eighteen years old. To have graduated from
high school with such honours that you are able to enter Vassar at
so early an age is much to your credit.
<p>I indulged in a good-natured laugh over your request for my
advice regarding a college course. You say, "I remember that I once
heard you state that you did not believe in higher education for
women, and, therefore, I am anxious to have your opinion of this
undertaking of mine."
<p>Now of course, my dear child, what you wish me to say is, that I
am charmed with your resolution to graduate from Vassar. You have
entered the college fully determined to take a complete course, and
you surely would not like a discouraging or disapproving letter
from your auntie.
<p>"Please give me your opinion of my course of action" always
means, "Please approve of what I am doing."
<p>Well I <i>do</i> approve. I always approve when a human being is
carrying out a determination, even if I am confident it is the
wrong determination.
<p>The really useful knowledge of life must come through strong
convictions. Strong convictions are usually obtained only on the
pathway of personal experience.
<p>To argue a man out of a certain course of action rarely argues
away his own beliefs and desires in the matter. We may save him
some bitter experience in the contemplated project, but he is
almost certain to find that same bitter experience later, because
he has been coerced, not enlightened.
<p>Had he gained his knowledge in the first instance, he would have
escaped the later disaster.
<p>A college education does not seem to me the most desirable thing
for a woman, unless she intends to enter into educational pursuits
as a means of livelihood. I understand it is your intention to
become a teacher, and, therefore, you are wise to prepare yourself
by a thorough education. <i>Be the very best</i>, in whatever line
of employment you enter.
<p>Scorn any half-way achievements. Make yourself a brilliantly
educated woman, but look to it that in the effort you do not forget
two other important matters&mdash;health and sympathy. My objection to
higher education for women, which you once heard me express, is
founded on the fact that I have met many college women who were
anaemic and utterly devoid of emotion. One beautiful young girl I
recall who at fourteen years of age seemed to embody all the
physical and temperamental charms possible for womankind. Softly
rounded features, vivid colouring, voluptuous curves of form, yet
delicacy and refinement in every portion of her anatomy, she
breathed love and radiated sympathy. I thought of her as the ideal
woman in embryo; and the brightness of her intellect was the
finishing touch to a perfect girlhood. I saw her again at
twenty-four. She had graduated from an American college and had
taken two years in a foreign institution of learning. She had
carried away all the honours&mdash;but, alas, the higher education had
carried away all her charms of person and of temperament.
Attenuated, pallid, sharp-featured, she appeared much older than
her years, and the lovely, confiding and tender qualities of mind,
which made her so attractive to older people, had given place to
cold austerity and hypercriticism.
<p>Men were only objects of amusement, indifference, or ridicule to
her. Sentiment she regarded as an indication of crudity, emotion as
an insignia of vulgarity. The heart was a purely physical organ,
she knew from her studies in anatomy. It was no more the seat of
emotion than the liver or lungs. The brain was the only portion of
the human being which appealed to her, and "educated" people were
the only ones who interested her, because they were capable of
argument and discussion of intellectual problems&mdash;her one source of
entertainment.
<p>Half an hour in the society of this over-trained young person
left one exhausted and disillusioned with brainy women. I beg you
to pay no such price for an education as this young girl paid. I
remember you as a robust, rosy girl, with charming manners. Your
mother was concerned, on my last visit, because I called you a
pretty girl in your hearing. She said the one effort of her life
was to rear a sensible Christian daughter with no vanity. She could
not understand my point of view when I said I should regret it if a
daughter of mine was without vanity, and that I should strive to
awaken it in her. Cultivate enough vanity to care about your
personal appearance and your deportment. No amount of education can
recompense a woman for the loss of complexion, figure, or charm.
And do not let your emotional and affectional nature grow
atrophied.
<p>Control your emotions, but do not crucify them.
<p>Do not mistake frigidity for serenity, nor austerity for
self-control. Be affable, amiable, and sweet, no matter how much
you know. And listen more than you talk.
<p>The woman who knows how to show interest is tenfold more
attractive than the woman who is for ever anxious to instruct.
Learn how to call out the best in other people, and lead them to
talk of whatever most interests them. In this way you will gain a
wide knowledge of human nature, which is the best education
possible. Try and keep a little originality of thought, which is
the most difficult of all undertakings while in college; and, if
possible, be as lovable a woman when you go forth into the world
"finished" as when you entered the doors of your Alma Mater: for to
be unlovable is a far greater disaster than to be uneducated.
<hr class="c2">
<a name="To_Edna_Gordon"></a>
<h2>To Edna Gordon</h2>
<p class="c3">During Her Honeymoon<br>
<p>I am very much flattered that you should write your first letter
as Mrs. Gordon to me. Its receipt was a surprise, as I have known
you so slightly&mdash;only when we were both guests under a friend's roof
for one week.
<p>I had no idea that you were noticing me particularly at that
time, there was such a merry crowd of younger people about you. How
careful we matrons should be, when in the presence of
d&eacute;butantes, for it seems they are taking notes for future
reference!
<p>I am glad that my behaviour and conversation were such that you
feel you can ask me for instructions at this important period of
your life. Here is the text you have given me:
<p>"<i>I want you to tell me, dear Mrs. West, how to be as happy,
and loved, and loving, after fifteen years of married life, as you
are. I so dread the waning of my honeymoon</i>."
<p>And now you want me to preach you a little sermon on this text.
Well, my dear girl, I am at a disadvantage in not knowing you
better, and not knowing your husband at all.
<p>Husbands are like invalids, each needs a special prescription,
according to his ailment.
<p>But as all invalids can be benefited by certain sensible
suggestions, like taking simple food, and breathing and exercising
properly, and sleeping with open windows or out-of-doors, so all
husbands can be aided toward perpetual affection by the observance
of some general laws, on the part of the wife.
<p>I am, of course, to take it for granted that you have married a
man with principles and ideals, a man who loves you and desires to
make a good husband. I know you were not so unfortunate as to
possess a large amount of property for any man to seek, and so I
can rely upon the natural supposition that you were married for
love.
<p>It might be worth your while, right now, while your husband's
memory is fresh upon the subject, to ask him what particular
characteristics first won his attention, and what caused him to
select you for a life companion.
<p>Up to the present moment, perhaps, he has never told you any
more substantial reason for loving you than the usual lovers'
explanation&mdash;"Just because." But if you ask him to think it over, I
am sure he can give you a more explicit answer.
<p>After you have found what qualities, habits, actions, or
accomplishments attracted him, write them down in a little book and
refer to them two or three times a year. On these occasions ask
yourself if you are keeping these attractions fresh and bright as
they were in the days of courtship. Women easily drop the things
which won a man's heart, and are unconscious that the change they
bemoan began in themselves. But do not imagine you can rest at ease
after marriage with only the qualities, and charms, and virtues,
which won you a lover. To keep a husband in love is a more serious
consideration than to win a lover.
<p>You must add year by year to your attractions.
<p>As the deep bloom of first youth passes, you must cultivate
mental and spiritual traits which will give your face a lustre from
within.
<p>And as the mirth and fun of life drifts farther from you, and
you find the merry jest, which of old turned care into laughter,
less ready on your lip, you must cultivate a wholesome optimistic
view of life, to sustain your husband through the trials and
disasters besetting most mortal paths.
<p>Make one solemn resolve now, and never forget it. Say to
yourself, "On no other spot, in no other house on earth, shall my
husband find a more cheerful face, a more loving welcome, or a more
restful atmosphere, than he finds at home."
<p>No matter what vicissitudes arise, and what complications occur,
keep that resolve. It will at least help to sustain you with a
sense of self-respect, if unhappiness from any outside source
should shadow your life. An attractive home has become a sort of
platitude in speech, but it remains a thing of vital importance,
all the same, in actual life and in marriage.
<p>Think often and speak frequently to your husband of his good
qualities and of the things you most admire in him.
<p>Sincere and judicious praise is to noble nature like spring rain
and sun to the earth. Ignore or make light of his small failings,
and when you must criticize a serious fault, do not dwell upon it.
A husband and wife should endeavour to be such good friends that
kindly criticism is accepted as an evidence of mutual love which
desires the highest attainments for its object.
<p>But no man likes to think his wife has set about the task of
making him over, and if you have any such intention I beg you to
conceal it, and go about it slowly and with caution.
<p>A woman who knows how to praise more readily than she knows how
to criticize, and who has the tact and skill to adapt herself to a
man's moods and to find amusement and entertainment in his whims,
can lead him away from their indulgence without his knowledge.
<p>Such women are the real reformers of men, though they scorn the
word, and disclaim the effort.
<p>It is well to keep a man conscious that you are a refined and
delicate-minded woman, yet do not insist upon being worshipped on a
pedestal. It tires a man's neck to be for ever gazing upward, and
statues are less agreeable companions than human beings.
<p>If you wish to be thought spotless marble, instead of warm flesh
and blood, you should have gone into a museum, and refused
marriage. Remember God knew what He was about, when He fashioned
woman to be man's companion, mate, and mother of his children.
<p>Respect yourself in all those capacities, and regard the
fulfilment of each duty as sacred and beautiful.
<p>Do not thrust upon the man's mind continually the idea that you
are a vastly higher order of being than he is.
<p>He will reach your standard much sooner if you come half-way and
meet him on the plane of common sense and human understanding.
Meantime let him never doubt your abhorrence of vulgarity, and your
distaste for the familiarity which breeds contempt.
<p>It is a great art, when a wife knows how to attract a husband
year after year, with the allurements of the boudoir, and never to
disillusion him with the familiarities of the dressing-room.
<p>Such women there are, who have lived with their lovers in
poverty's close quarters, and through sickness and trouble, and yet
have never brushed the bloom from the fruit of romance. But she who
needs to be told in what this art consists, would never understand,
and she who understands, need not be told.
<p>Keep your husband certain of the fact that his attention and
society is more agreeable to you than that of any other man. But
never beg for his attentions, and do not permit him to think you
are incapable of enjoying yourself without his playing the devoted
cavalier.
<p>The moment a man feels such an attitude is compulsory, it
becomes irksome. Learn how to entertain yourself. Cling to your
accomplishments and add others. A man admires a progressive woman
who keeps step with the age. Study, and think, and read, and
cultivate the art of listening. This will make you interesting to
men and women alike, and your husband will hear you praised as an
agreeable and charming woman, and that always pleases a man, as it
indicates his good taste and good luck.
<p>Avoid giving your husband the impression that you expect a
detailed account of every moment spent away from you. Convince him
that you believe in his honour and loyalty, and that you have no
desire to control or influence his actions in any matters which do
not conflict with his self-respect or your pride.
<p>Cultivate the society of the women he admires. There is both
wisdom and tact in such a course.
<p>Wisdom in making an ideal a reality, and tact in avoiding any
semblance of that most unbecoming fault&mdash;jealousy.
<p>Let him see that you have absolute faith in your own powers to
hold him, and that you respect him too much to mistake a frank
admiration for an unworthy sentiment. Do not hesitate to speak with
equal frankness of the qualities you admire in other men. Educate
him in liberality and generosity, by example.
<p>Allow no one to criticize him in your presence, and do not
discuss his weaknesses with others. I have known wives to meet in
conclaves, and dissect husbands for an entire afternoon. And each
wife seemed anxious to pose as the most neglected and unappreciated
woman of the lot. With all the faults of the sterner sex, I never
heard of such a caucus of husbands.
<p>Take an interest in your husband's business affairs, and
sympathize with the cares and anxieties which beset him. Distract
his mind with pleasant or amusing conversation, when you find him
nervous and fagged in brain and body.
<p>Yet do not feel that you must never indicate any trouble of your
own, for it is conducive to selfishness when a wife hides all her
worries and indispositions to listen to those of her husband. But
since the work-a-day world, outside the home, is usually filled
with irritations for a busy man, it should be a wife's desire to
make his home-coming a season of anticipation and joy.
<p>Do not expect a husband to be happy and contented with a
continuous diet of love and sentiment and romance. He needs also
much that is practical and commonplace mingled with his mental
food.
<p>I have known an adoring young wife to irritate Cupid so he went
out and sat on the door-step, contemplating flight, by continual
neglect of small duties.
<p>There were never any matches in the receivers; when the husband
wanted one he was obliged to search the house. The newspaper he had
folded and left ready to read at leisure was used to light the
fire, although an overfilled waste-basket stood near. The
towel-rack was empty just when he wanted his bath, and his bedroom
slippers were always kicked so far under the bed that he was
obliged to crawl on all fours to reach them.
<p>Then his loving spouse was sure to want to be "cuddled" when he
was smoking his cigar and reading,&mdash;a triple occupation only
possible to a human freak, with three arms, four eyes, and two
mouths.
<p>Therefore I would urge you, my dear Edna, to mingle the
practical with the ideal, and common sense with sentiment, and tact
with affection, in your domestic life.
<p>These general rules are all I can give to guide your barque into
the smooth, sea of marital happiness.
<p>It is a wide sea, with many harbours and ports, and no two ships
start from exactly the same point or take exactly the same course.
You will encounter rocks and reefs, perhaps, which my boat escaped,
and I have no chart to guide you away from those rocks.
<p>If I knew you better, and knew your husband at all, I might
steer you a little farther out of Honeymoon Bay into calm waters,
and tell you how to reef your sails, and how to tack at certain
junctures of the voyage, and with the wind in certain directions.
<p>But if you keep your heart full of love, your mind clear of
distrust, and your lips free from faultfinding, and if you pray for
guidance and light upon your way, I am sure you cannot miss the
course.

<h2>To Miss Gladys Weston</h2>
<p class="c3">Who Faces the Necessity to Earn a Living<br>
<p>It is indeed a problem, my dear Gladys, to face stern-visaged
Necessity after walking with laughing-lipped Pleasure for
twenty-two years.
<p>What an unforeseen event that your father should sink his
fortune in a rash venture and die of remorse and discouragement
scarcely six months after you were travelling through Europe with
me, and laughing at my vain attempts to make you economize.
<p>You have acted the noble and womanly part, in using the last
dollar of your father's property to pay his debts, and I could
imagine you doing no other way.
<p>But now comes the need of earning a livelihood for yourself, and
your delicate mother.
<p>I know you have gone over the list of your accomplishments and
taken stock of all your inherited and acquired qualities. You play
the piano well, but in these days of Paderewskies and pianolas, no
one wants to employ a young girl music-teacher. You do not sing,
and if you did, that would not afford you a means of support. The
best of natural voices need a fortune spent before half a fortune
can be earned.
<p>You dance like a fairy, and swim like a mermaid, and ride like
an Indian princess, but these accomplishments are not lucrative,
save in a Midway Plaisance or a Wild West show. You are well
educated and your memory is remarkable. You have a facility in
mathematics, and your knowledge of grammar and rhetoric will, as
you say, enable you to pass the examination for a teacher in the
public schools after a little brushing up and study. Then, with the
political influence of your father's old friends, you will no doubt
be able to obtain a position.
<p>I recollect you as surpassingly skilful with the needle. I know
you once saw a charming morning gown in Paris which I persuaded you
not to buy at the absurd price asked for it, after the merchant
understood we were Americans. And I remember how you passed to
another department, purchased materials, went home to our hotel,
and cut and made a surprising imitation of the gown at one-tenth
the cost.
<p>Why have you not considered turning this talent to account?
Though the world goes to war and ruin, yet women will dress, and
the need of good seamstresses ever exists.
<p>Go to some enterprising half-grown Western or interior Eastern
town, announce yourself in possession of all the Paris styles (as
you are), and launch out. Increase your prices gradually, and go
abroad on your savings at the end of a year, then come back with
new ideas, a larger stock, and higher prices.
<p>You will be on the road to fortune, and can retire with a
competence before you are middle-aged. A little skill with the
scissors and needle, lots of courage and audacity, and original
methods will make a woman succeed in this line of endeavour.
<p>But why do I not approve of the profession upon which you have
almost decided&mdash;that of teaching&mdash;you ask.
<p>I will tell you why.
<p>Next to motherhood, the profession of teacher in public or
private schools is the most important one on earth.
<p>It is, in a certain sense, more responsible than that of
motherhood, since the work of poor and bad mothers must be undone
by the teacher, and where the mother has three or four children for
a period of years to influence, the teacher has hundreds
continually. There are very few perfect teachers. There are too few
excellent ones. There are too many poor ones. I do not believe you
possess the requisites for the calling.
<p>A teacher should first of all love children as a class. Their
dependence, their ignorance, their helplessness, and their unformed
characters should appeal to a woman's mind, and make her forget
their many and varied faults and irritating qualities. You like
lovable, well-bred, and interesting children, but you are utterly
indifferent to all others. You adore beauty, and an ugly child
offends your taste. A stupid child irritates you.
<p>You have a wonderful power of acquiring and remembering
information, but you do not possess the knack of readily imparting
it. You expect others to grasp ideas in the same way you do. This
will make you unsympathetic and impatient as a teacher. You have no
conception of the influence a teacher exerts upon children in
public schools. You were educated in private schools and at home, I
know. I attended the country public school, and to this day I can
recall the benefits and misfortunes which resulted to me from
association with different teachers. Children are keenly alive to
the moods of teachers and are often adepts in mind-reading.
<p>A teacher should be able to enter into the hearts and souls of
the children under her charge, and she should find as great
pleasure in watching their minds develop as the musical genius in
watching a composition grow under his touch.
<p>An infinite number of things not included in the school routine
should be taught by teachers. Courtesy, kindness to dependents and
weaker creatures, a horror of cruelty in all forms, a love of
nature, politeness to associates, low speaking and light walking,
cleanliness and refinement of manner,&mdash;all these may be imparted by
a teacher who loves to teach, without extra time or fatigue. I fear
a proud disdain, and a scarcely hidden disgust, would be plainly
visible in your demeanour toward the majority of the untrained
little savages given to your charge in a public school. You have
not the love of humanity at large in your heart, nor the patience
and perseverance to make you take an optimistic view in the
colossal work of developing the minds of children. Therefore it
seems to me almost a sin for you to undertake the profession merely
because you need to earn a living. There are other things to be
considered besides your necessities. Fond as I am of you, I have
the betterment of humanity at my heart, too, and cannot feel it is
right for you to place yourself in a position where you will not be
doing the best for those dependent upon you that could be done.
<p>I have given up hope of seeing mothers made to realize their
responsibilities. But I still have hope of the teachers. On them
and their full understanding of all it is in their power to do,
lies the hope of the world.
<p>Therefore, my dear girl, I urge you to take up dressmaking or
millinery instead of school-teaching.
<p>If you ruin a piece of goods in the making, you can replace it
and profit by your error. But if you mar a child's nature in your
attempt to teach him, you have done an irreparable injury not only
to him but to humanity.
<p>If you saw a design started by a lace-maker, you would not think
of taking the work and attempting to complete it until you had
learned the art of lace-making.
<p>Just so you ought not to think of developing the wonderful
intricacies of a child's mind until you have learned how.
<p>It is all right to deliberately choose a vocation which gives us
contact only with inanimate things, but we have no right to take
the handling of human souls unless we are specially fitted for the
task.
<hr class="c2">
<a name="To_Clarence_St_Claire"></a>
<h2>To Clarence St. Claire</h2>
<p class="c3">Regarding His Sister's Betrothal<br>
<p>Your request, my dear Clarence, that I try to influence your
sister to change her determination in this matter, calls for some
very plain statements from me.
<p>I have known you and Elise since you were playing with marbles
and rattles, and your mother and I have been very good
acquaintances (scarcely intimate enough to be called friends) for
more than a score of years. You are very much like your mother,
both in exterior appearance and in mind. Elise is the image of her
father at the time he captured your mother's romantic fancy, and as
I recollect him when he died.
<p>You were five years old, Elise three, at that time. Your mother
lived with your father six years in months, an eternity in
experience. You know that she was unhappy, and that he
disillusioned her with love, and almost with life. He married your
mother solely for her fortune. She was a sweet and beautiful girl,
of excellent family, but your father had no qualities of mind or
soul which enabled him to appreciate or care for any woman, save as
she could be of use to him, socially and financially.
<p>In six years he managed to dispose of all but a mere pittance of
her fortune, and humiliated her in a thousand ways besides. His
only decent act was to die and leave her undisturbed for the
remainder of her life. Your uncle assisted in her support and saved
the remnant of her property, so that she has, by careful and
rigorous economy, been able to educate you and Elise, and keep up a
respectable appearance in a quiet way.
<p>Of course it was impossible to retain her place among the
associates of her better days, and you know how bitter this fact
has always made Elise. Your sister has the physical beauty and the
overwhelming love of money and power which characterized your
father. She has a modicum of your mother's sense of honour, but has
been reared in a way not calculated to develop much strength of
character. Your mother has been a slave to your sister. Elise is
incapable of a deep, intense love for any man, and your mother's
pessimistic ideas of love and marriage have still further acted
upon her brain cells and atrophied whatever impulses may have been
latent in her nature, to love and be loved. These qualities might
have been developed had Elise been under the tutelage of some one
versed in the science of brain building, but your mother, like most
mothers, was not aware of the tremendous possibilities within her
grasp, or of the effect of the ideas she expressed in the hearing
of her children. Neither did she seem to recognize the father's
traits in Elise, and undertake the work of eliminating them, as she
might have done. She has been an unselfish and devoted mother, and
has made too many sacrifices for Elise. At the same time, she has
awakened the mind of your sister to ideals of principle and honour
which will help her to be a better woman than her inheritance from
your father would otherwise permit. But now, at the age of
twenty-one, it is impossible to hope that she will develop into a
self-sacrificing, loving, womanly woman, whose happiness can be
found in a peaceful domestic life. She has seen your mother sad and
despondent, under the yoke of genteel poverty, and heard her bemoan
her lost privileges of wealth and station. This, added to her
natural craving for money and place, renders a wealthy marriage her
only hope of happiness on earth.
<p>Mr. Volney has an enormous fortune. He is, as you say, a senile
old man in his dotage. As you say again, such a marriage is a
travesty. But Elise is incapable of feeling the love which alone
renders marriage a holy institution. She has undesirable qualities
which ought not to be transmitted to children, and she is
absolutely devoid of maternal instincts.
<p>I have heard her say she would consider motherhood the greatest
disaster which could befall her. But she is unfitted for a
self-supporting career, and she wants a home and position.
<p>She has beauty, kind and generous impulses, and a love of
playing Lady Bountiful. It is not so much that she wants to benefit
the needy, as that she likes to place people under obligations and
to have them look up to her as a superior being.
<p>Old Mr. Volney is a miser, and his money is doing no one good.
He has only distant relatives, and by taking Elise for a wife
(according to law) he will wrong no one, and she will make much
better use of his fortune than his heirs would make.
<p>Your mother will be relieved of worry and care. Many worthy poor
people and charities will receive help, and Elise will have her
heart's desire&mdash;fine apparel, jewels, a social position, and no one
to bother her. The valet and nurse will look after Mr. Volney, and
his simple old heart will bask in the pride of an old man&mdash;the
possession of a pretty young wife.
<p>Had he full use of his mental faculties, and did he long for
love and devotion, I would try and dissuade Elise from the
marriage, but solely on <i>his</i> account, not on hers.
<p>The young man you mention, as your choice of a suitor for the
hand of your sister, might better go up in a balloon to seek for
Eutopia than to expect happiness as her husband. He has a sweet,
gentle, loving nature, a taste for quiet home joys, fondness for
children, and he has two thousand a year, with small prospects of
more in the near future.
<p>He should marry a modest, domestic girl, with tastes similar to
his own, and with no overweening ambitions. Elise would simply
drive him mad in a year's time, with her restless discontent, her
extravagance, and her desire for the expensive pleasures of earth.
It is useless to reason with her, or to expect her to model her
ideas to suit her circumstances. Inheritance and twenty-one years
of wrong education must be taken into consideration. What would
mean happiness for many women would mean misery for her. I can
imagine no more dreadful destiny than to be tied to a senile old
man by a legal ceremony, even were I given his millions in payment.
But that will mean happiness to Elise.
<p>I think we should let people seek their own ideals of happiness,
when they break no law, and injure no other life by it.
<p>I shall congratulate Elise by this post on having made so
fortunate an alliance. I could not congratulate her were she to
marry her young suitor. I shall congratulate your mother on having
nothing to worry about, regarding the future of Elise.
<p>And I advise you to take a philosophical view of the situation,
and to remember that, in judging the actions of our fellow beings,
we must take their temperaments, characteristics, and environment
into consideration, not our own.
<p>You have made the very common error of thinking, because Elise
is a handsome young girl, that love, and home, and children would
mean happiness to her.
<p>Women vary as greatly as do plants and flowers in their needs.
The horticulturist knows that he cannot treat them all alike, and
he studies their different requirements.
<p>To some he gives moisture and sun, to some shade, and to some
dry, sandy soil. The thistle pushes forth a gorgeous bloom from an
arid bed. It would die in the pond where the lily thrives.
<p>Too much sentiment is wasted in this world and too much effort
expended in trying to make all people happy in some one way.
<p>When I was a little girl, a Sunday-school superintendent
presented every girl in the class with a doll, and each doll was
exactly the same. Most little girls like dolls, but I never played
with one, as they were always so hopelessly inanimate. If the good
man had given me a sled, or a book, or a picture, I would have been
happy. As it was, his gift was a failure. You want to present your
sister with a devoted young husband, a cottage, and several
children, because you think every woman should possess these
things. Your sister happens to be one who prefers a wealthy old
invalid.
<p>Let her have what she wants, my dear Clarence, and let her work
out her destiny in her own way. She will do less harm in the world
than if you forced her into your way. Now you must remember that
you asked me to help you in this matter, and I could only write you
the absolute facts of the situation, as I knew it to be. I feel
fairly confident that you will accept my point of view, and act as
best man at your sister's wedding.
<hr class="c2">
<a name="To_Miss_Margaret_Riley"></a>
<h2>To Miss Margaret Riley</h2>
<p class="c3">Shop Girl, Concerning Her Oppressors<br>
<p>Your letter has been destroyed, as you requested, and you need
not fear my betraying your confidence.
<p>Your mother was so long in my employ that I feel almost like a
foster-mother to you, having seen you grow up from the cradle to
self-supporting young womanhood.
<p>The troubles and evils which you mention as existing about you,
I know to be quite universal in all large shops, factories, and
department stores, indeed in all houses where the two sexes are
employed.
<p>I know that a certain order of men in power use that power to
lower the ideals and standards of womanhood when they can.
<p>A pretty young girl once in my service related to me the
cold-blooded suggestions made to her by her employer to increase
the miserable wage paid her in a sweat-shop.
<p>The sacrifice of her virtue seemed no more to this man than the
sale of an old garment.
<p>The girl did not make the sacrifice, however, and she did not
starve, freeze, or die. She managed to exist and to better her
condition by doing domestic work and saving her money to fit
herself for more congenial employment. When I last saw her she was
planning to become a trained nurse, and had paid for a course of
instruction in massage. I tell you this merely to illustrate a fact
I fully believe, that any girl who is determined to live an
honourable life and retain her self-respect can make her way in the
world and rise from lesser to higher positions, if she is patient
and willing to do what is termed menial work as a stepping-stone.
You tell me that scores of girls are kept in poorly paying,
inferior positions when capable of filling better places, simply
because they will not accept the dishonourable attentions of some
of the men in authority.
<p>You beg me to arouse the good women of America to a crusade
against what you say is a growing evil and to boycott such shops
and stores.
<p>But you ask me to do what is an impracticable thing.
<p>You would not like to be called as a witness were this matter
brought before the courts. Were all the good women of America to
begin such a crusade, where would they obtain the proofs of their
accusations?
<p>And even if the witnesses were ready, there is not a newspaper
in the land that would dare champion the reform. And no great
reform can be made without the aid of the press. The daily papers,
as you say, give columns to protests against lesser evils, but you
must know that these newspapers are largely supported by the
profitable advertisements of manufactories and dry-goods houses.
Glance over the columns of any of our large dailies and see how
much space such advertising occupies.
<p>Imagine what it would mean to lose all this high-priced
patronage. Therefore, even if the most moral of editors knew that
these establishments were undermining our social conditions and
invading our homes, I doubt if he could be induced to make a
protest. It is a curious thing to see how many are the kinds of
victims caught and held in the clutches of the money-devil-fish in
our wonderful land of freedom.
<p>Even clergymen who are preaching morality and brotherly love are
compelled to keep their mouths shut on certain evils and abuses,
lest they offend the pillars of the church and deprive the treasury
of its income.
<p>In a certain New England town famous for its educational
institution, a clergyman denounced a corporation which had swindled
the poor and deceived scores of citizens. He was requested to
discontinue further references to the matter, as the church
treasury was supplied by the money which accrued from this
monopoly.
<p>The most powerful members of the church were officers in the
corporation.
<p>The young clergyman sent in his resignation and gave up an
assured salary to follow the light of his own conscience. But there
are few with his bravery and, therefore, the strongholds of
selfishness and self-indulgence remain impregnable. While we admire
the splendid character which makes a man capable of refusing a
salary which means hush-money, we can at the same time understand
the difficult position of a clergyman with a hungry brood of
children to support, who hesitates at such a move. We can
understand how he argues with himself, that by taking the money of
the monopolists, he is able to do more good for humanity than by
refusing it, and losing both influence and income. It is a false
argument, yet the worn and weary mind of the average orthodox
minister will accept it as the advisable course to pursue. So you
will see how difficult is the task you suggest my undertaking. You
tell me that it is useless for you to leave one shop and go to
another, as all are more or less conducted on the same lines; and
that it is mere chance if a girl finds herself in a position where
she can advance on her merits. Even then a sudden change in heads
of departments some day may destroy all her hopes.
<p>You say I have no idea how many girls go wrong just through the
persecution and tyranny of these men&mdash;forced to fall in order to
keep herself fed and clothed. I repeat what I said already in this
connection,&mdash;that I am certain any girl determined to keep herself
above reproach and ambitious to rise in the world can do so. She
may have to endure many privations and sorrows for a time, and that
time may seem long and weary, <i>but a change will come for the
better as surely as spring follows winter, if she does not
waver</i>.
<p>If you will look carefully into the facts of the cases which
fall under your observation, I am confident you will see that it is
vanity and indolence, not hunger and oppression, which cause the
majority of the girls you mention to go astray. They desire to make
as good an appearance, and to be given the same privileges of
leisure, as the favourite who has been promoted through unworthy
methods.
<p>You tell me you would rather jump from Brooklyn Bridge and end
the struggle at once than lose your self-respect, but that you are
weary of seeing the girls with less conscience, and lesser
capabilities, pushed ahead of you and your worthy associates. Yet I
am certain from the tone of your letter that you will never forget
your self-respect, and I have faith that you can make your way in
the world in spite of all the designing masculine oppressors in
existence.
<p>So will any woman, who sets her mark high, and believes in the
invincible power of her own spirit to conquer all the demons of
earth.
<p>Do not imagine your position is one of unusual trial and
temptation. A young actress of my acquaintance has been obliged to
fight her way slowly to partial recognition because she would not
accept the conditions offered, with leading r&ocirc;les and fine
wardrobe, by two polygamous-minded managers.
<p>She is making her way, however, and the very battle she is
fighting with life has strengthened her powers as an artist. A
young stenographer has been compelled to give up two positions
because she would not allow the loverlike attentions of married
employers. She was called a silly prude and discharged. Yet she is
occupying an excellent position with a clean high-class business
house to-day.
<p>Domestics are sometimes driven from private homes by the same
pursuit of the employer. Men are only in a state of evolution, and
the animal instincts are still strong in them. The world has
allowed them so much license, and society has been so lenient with
their misdeeds, that it has been difficult for them to practise
self-control and aspire to a higher standard. You must be sorry for
them and do what you can to help them understand the worth and
value of true womanhood. Never for one instant believe that you can
be hindered by the machinations of a few unworthy men, from
reaching any goal you set.
<p>One good, intelligently virtuous woman, determined to make the
most of her capabilities by fair methods, can overcome a whole army
of self-indulgent, sensual men, and compel them to doff their hats
to her. I am always deeply sympathetic toward the girl who is
tempted through her emotions, or her affections, to forget herself.
But I have no great pity for the woman who sells herself. There are
always charitable societies, and there are always menial labours to
do, and either door of escape from the sale of honour would be
sought by the girl of right ideals. It is a bitter experience to
see the woman who <i>has</i> stepped down into the soil of life
flaunting her finery and her power in the face of virtue. But look
about you and see how soon the finery becomes tatters&mdash;how soon the
power is transferred to another.
<p>Woman's position in the world is growing better, brighter, and
more independent with each year. There are more avenues open to
her&mdash;larger opportunities waiting for the employment of her
abilities. She has tried a thorny path for centuries, but she has
small reason to despair of her outlook to-day.
<p>Each woman must fight her battle alone, and walk by the light
from within.
<p>The world gives her only a superficial protection, either
through its courts or its society.
<p>Men demand virtue from woman and endeavour in every way to lead
her away from its path.
<p>But the divinity within her can carry her to the heights, if she
will not be lured by the voice of the senses, or frightened by the
demands of the appetite, or debased by the mercenary spirit of the
age.
<p>Go on in your brave determination to lead a sensible and moral
life, my dear girl, and let your example be a guide to others, and
prove that woman may succeed on the right basis if she will, in
spite of temptations and oppressions.

<a name="To_Miss_Gladys_Weston2"></a>
<h2>To Miss Gladys Weston</h2>
<p class="c3">After Three Years as a Teacher<br>
<p>The way you took my frank criticisms and doubts of your ability
to make a good school-teacher, proves you to be a girl of much
character. Your success proves, too, that given the general
qualifications of a fairly capable and educated human being, add
concentration and will, and we can achieve wonders in any line of
work we undertake. I am still of the opinion that no woman of my
acquaintance was more wholly unfit to teach young children, as they
should be taught, than your fair self as I last knew you.
<p>I take pride in believing that my heroic methods were what
brought out the undeveloped qualities you needed to ensure such
success.
<p>There are certain natures that need to be antagonized before
they do their best. Others are prostrated and robbed of all
strength by a criticism or a doubt.
<p>You have realized this, I am sure, in your experiences with
pupils. "<i>You cannot do it</i>" is a more stimulating war-cry to
some people than "<i>You can</i>." And to such the sneer of the foe
does more good, than the smile of the friend. A phrenologist would
tell us that strongly developed organs of self-esteem and love of
approbation accompanied this trait of character.
<p>I am sure it proves to be the case with you.
<p>Brought up as you were, the only child of indulgent parents, and
given admiration and praise by all your associates, you could
hardly reach the age of twenty-two without having developed
self-esteem and love of praise. You were naturally brighter than
most of your companions. (They were also children of fortune, as
the term goes, but to my idea the children reared in wealth, are
usually children of misfortune. For the real fortune of life is to
encounter the discipline which brings out our strongest qualities.)
<p>Your father was a poor boy, who fought his way up to wealth and
power before you were born; but he unfortunately wanted the earth
beside, and so died in poverty after staking all he had, which was
enough, to make more, which he did not need.
<p>You inherit much of his force of character, and that is what
gave you the reputation of extreme cleverness among your more
commonplace companions. Compared with the really brilliant and
talented people of earth, you are not clever. That is why I found
you so companionable and charming, no doubt; for the brilliant
people&mdash;especially women&mdash;are rarely companionable for more than a
few hours at a time. I gave you that supreme test of friendship&mdash;the
companionship of travel for a period of months. And I loved you
better at the end of the time than at the beginning.
<p>I have often thought how much less occupation there would be for
the divorce courts and how many more "indefinitely postponed"
announcements of engagements would result from an established
custom of a pre-betrothal trip!
<p>If a young man and woman who were enamoured could travel for two
or three months, with a chaperon (in the shape of a mother-in-law
or two), the lawyers would lose much profit; but I fear race
suicide might ensue. Nothing, unless it is the sick-room or the
card-table, brings out the real characteristics of human beings
like travel.
<p>The irritating delays of boats and trains, and the still more
irritating unresponsiveness of officials, when asked the cause,
will test the temper and the patience of even a pair of lovers. It
is not surprising if the traveller does lose both at times, but it
is admirable if he does not. I remember how adorable you were,
while I was a bundle of dynamite, ready to explode and send the
stolid, uncommunicative conductor and brakemen into a journey
through space, when we suffered that long delay coming from
California. It is due the travelling public to explain such delays,
but the railroads of America have grown to feel that they owe no
explanation to any one, even to God, for what they do or do not.
While I lost vitality and composure by such idle reflections, you
were amusing the nervous travellers by your bright bits of
narrative and ready repartee. That fortunate fellow you have
promised to marry at the end of two years has no idea what a
charming companion he will find in you for travel.
<p>It is interesting to have you say you feel that you need two
more years as a teacher, before you are fully developed enough to
take up the responsibilities of marriage. You will be twenty-seven
then:&mdash;that is the age at which the average American girl begins to
be most interesting, and the age when she is first physically
mature.
<p>And your children will be more fully endowed mentally than if
you had become a mother in your teens.
<p>As a rule the brainy people of the world are not born of very
youthful parents; you will find youth gives physique, maturity
gives brains to offspring.
<p>I did not quite finish my train of reasoning about your
self-esteem.
<p>It was because you had always believed yourself to be capable of
doing anything you undertook to do, that you were roused by my
assertion that you could not make a good school-teacher, to attempt
it. I hurt your pride a bit, and you were determined to prove me
wrong. Had you been self-depreciating and oversensitive, what I
said would have turned you from that field of effort. And that
would have been a desirable result, since one who can be turned
from any undertaking <i>ought to be</i>.
<p>I still think the world has lost a wonderful artist by your not
entering the lists of designers and dressmakers. But since my
recital of the faults which would prevent your success as a teacher
led you to overcome them, I am proud and glad, that you have gone
on in the work you contemplated. Good teachers are more needed than
good dressmakers.
<p>And you are sweet and charming as usual, to tell me that your
popularity with children and parents, is greatly due to that letter
of mine.
<p>What you write me of the young girl who is making you so much
trouble by her jealousy of all other pupils, interests and saddens
me. Her devotion to you is of that morbid type, so unwholesome and
so dangerous to her peace, and the peace of all her associates. It
is a misfortune that mothers do not take such traits in early
babyhood, and eradicate them by patient, practical methods.
Instead, this mother, like many others, seems to think her little
girl should be favoured and flattered because of her morbid
tendency.
<p>She mistakes selfishness, envy, greediness, and hysteria for a
loving nature.
<p>I can imagine your feelings when this mother told you with a
proud smile, "Allie always wants the whole attention of any one she
loves, and cannot stand sharing her friends. She was always that
way at home. We never could pet her little brother without her
going into a spasm. And you must be careful about showing the other
children attention before her. It just breaks her heart&mdash;she is so
sensitive."
<p>Oh, mothers, mothers, what are you thinking about, to be so
blind to the work put in your hands to do?
<p>You have little time comparatively to work upon this perverted
young mind: but under no conditions favour her, and, no matter what
scenes she makes, continue to give praise and affection to the
other children when it is their due. The prominence of her parents
in the neighbourhood, and the power her father wields in the school
board, need not worry you. Go ahead and do what is best for the
child and for the school at large. Never deviate one inch from your
convictions. Take Allie some day to a garden where there are many
flowers, and talk to her about them. Speak of all their different
charms, and gather a bouquet. Then say to her, "Now, Allie, you and
I love each of these pretty flowers, and see how sweetly they
nestle together in your hand. Not one is jealous of the other. Each
has its place, and would be missed were it not there. The bouquet
needs them all. Just so I need all the dear children in my school,
and just so I would miss any one. It makes me ashamed to think any
little girl is more selfish and unreasonable than a plant, for
little girls are a higher order of creation, and we expect more of
them than we expect of plants or of animals. All are parts of God,
but the human kingdom is the highest expression of the Creator.
<p>"When you show such jealousy of other children I lose respect
for you, and cannot love you as much as I love them. When you are
gentle and good, and take your share of my love and attention, and
let others have their share, then I am proud of you and fond of
you. Suppose one plant said to the sunlight that it must have all
the sun, would not that be ridiculous and selfish?"
<p>I would make frequent references to this idea when alone with
her, and indeed it would serve as an excellent subject for a talk
to all your pupils some day. Then try and make Allie understand how
unbecoming and unlovable jealousy is, and how it renders a man or
woman an object of pity and ridicule to others.
<p>Praise the people you know who are liberal and broad, and
absolutely ignore her moods when in school.
<p>Perhaps in time you can do a little toward awakening her mind to
a more wholesome outlook.
<p>What you tell me of her hysterical devotion to one of her
classmates, makes me realize that the girl needs careful guidance.
<p>You should talk to her mother, and warn her against encouraging
such conditions of mind in her child.
<p>Urge her to keep the girl occupied, and to give her much
out-door life, and to teach her that pronounced demonstrations of
affection are not good form between young girls. The mother should
be careful what books she reads, and should see that she makes no
long visits to other homes and receives no guests for a continued
time. The child needs to cultivate universal love, not individual
devotion.
<p>Ideals, principles, ambitions, should be given the girl, not
close companions, for her nature is like a rank, weedy flower that
needs refining and cultivating into a perfected blossom.
<p>All this needs a mother's constant care and tact and
watchfulness. It is work she should have begun when her little girl
first indicated her unfortunate tendencies.
<p>It is late for you to undertake a reconstruction of the
misshapen character, but you may be able to begin an improvement,
and if you can obtain the mother's cooperation the full formation
may be accomplished.
<p>And do not fail to use mental suggestion constantly, and to help
the child by your assertions to be what you want her to become.
Dwell in conversation with her and in her presence, upon the
lovableness and charm of generosity of spirit in general, rather
than on the selfishness you observe in herself.
<p>At her least indication of an improvement, give her warm praise.
Be careful about bestowing caresses upon her, as she needs to be
guarded against hysteria, I should judge from your description. To
some children they are the sunlight, to others miasma.
<p>Think of yourself as God's agent, given charge of his unfinished
work, and recognize the unseen influences ready to aid you with
suggestion and courage when you appeal to them.

<h2>To a Young Friend</h2>
<p class="c3">Who Has Become Interested in the Metaphysical
Thoughts of the Day
<p>Your letter bubbled with enthusiasm, and steamed with optimism.
I am rejoiced that you have come into so healthful a line of
thought, for I know of no one who was in more immediate need of it
than you, when we last met.
<p>As your hostess, I could not tell you how wearing to the nerves
your continual reverting to your physical ills became: and I hope I
did not seem wholly unsympathetic to you when I so frequently made
the effort to change the conversation to more cheerful topics.
<p>And now you tell me that you are astounded to find how universal
is this topic with all classes, and on all occasions when one or
two human beings gather together even in "His name." Your recital
of the church sewing-bee, where all the good Christian women
described their diseases and the different operations they and
their friends had undergone, is as amusing as it is distressingly
realistic.
<p>What a pity that the old theology fostered the idea that God
especially loved the people he afflicted with illness and poverty
and trouble! It has filled the world with egotistical and selfish
invalids and idlers, who have believed they were "God's chosen
ones," instead of realizing that they were the natural results of
broken laws, which might be mended by the aid of the God-power in
themselves, once they understood it.
<p>How Christians have reconciled the idea of a God of love with a
God who wanted his chosen ones to be sick and poor, is a problem I
cannot solve.
<p>Of course you are well, and growing stronger daily, now that you
realize the fact that God made only health, wealth, and love, and
that he intended all his children to share his opulence.
<p>As soon as the mind is filled with a dominating idea, no lesser
ones can find lodgment therein.
<p>A woman of my acquaintance suffered agonies from seasickness.
<p>She crossed the ocean twice each year, yet seemed unable to
accustom herself to the experience.
<p>On her last voyage her child fell dangerously sick with typhoid
fever on the second day out at sea.
<p>So wrought up was the mother, and so filled with the thought of
her child, that she never felt one moment's seasickness. Her mind
was otherwise occupied.
<p>Now you have filled your mind with a consciousness of your
divine right to health and happiness, and the thought of sickness
and disease has no room.
<p>Yet do not be discouraged if you feel the old ailments and
indispositions returning at times. A complete change in mental
habits, is difficult to obtain in a moment.
<p>Be satisfied to grow slowly. A wise philosopher has said, "It is
not in never falling that we show our strength, but in our ability
to rise after repeated falls, and to continue our journey in
triumph."
<p>Avoid talking your belief to every individual you meet. It will
be breaking your string of pearls for the feet of swine to tread
upon. Those who are ready for these truths will indicate the fact
to you, and then will be your time for speech. And when you do
speak, say little, and say it briefly and to the point.
<p>Leave some things for other minds to study out alone. The people
who are not ready for higher ideals of religion and life, will only
ridicule or combat your theories and beliefs, if you force them to
listen.
<p>Wait until you have fully illustrated by your own conduct of
life, that you have something beside vague theories to prove your
statements of the power of the mind to conquer circumstance. The
world is full to-day of bedraggled and haggard men and women, who
are talking loudly of the power of mind to restore youth and
health, and bestow riches and success.
<p>Do not add yourself to the unlovely and tiresome army of
talkers, until you prove yourself a doer.
<p>And even after you have shown a record of health and prosperity
and usefulness, let your silent influence speak louder than your
uttered words.
<p>The moment a philosopher becomes a bore, he ceases to be a
philosopher.

<h2>To Wilfred Clayborn</h2>
<p class="c3">Concerning His Education and His Profession<br>
<p>My Dear Nephew:&mdash;I have considered your request from all sides,
and have resolved to disappoint you. This seems to me the kindest
thing I can do under the circumstances.
<p>You have gone through two years of college life, and I am sure
you are not an ignoramus. Most of the great men of the world's
history have enjoyed no fuller educational advantages. To lend you
money to finish the college course, would be to help you to start
life at the age of twenty-two under the burden of debt. If you are
determined to finish a college course, and feel that only by so
doing will you equip yourself for the duties of life, I would
advise you to drop out for a year and teach, or go into any kind of
work which will enable you to earn enough to proceed with your
studies. However hard and however disappointing this advice seems
to you, I know it suggests a course which will do more for your
character than all the money I could lend you.
<p>Aside from the fact that you would begin life with a debt, is
the possibility of your contracting the debt habit.
<p>One man in a thousand who borrows money to help himself along in
early life is benefited by it.
<p>The other 999 are harmed.
<p>To do anything on another's money is to lean on the shoulder of
another instead of walking upright. It is not good calisthenic
exercise.
<p>A few years ago I would have acceded to your request.
<p>But each year I live I realize more and more that lending money
is the last method to be used in helping people to better
themselves. In almost every case where I have lent money, I have
lived to regret it. Not because I lost my money (which has usually
been the fact), but because I lost respect for my friends.
<p>I remember the case of a young newspaper man and author, who
came to me for the loan of five dollars. I had never seen him
before, but I knew his brother, a brilliant playwright, in a social
way.
<p>The young man told me he had met with a series of disasters on
the voyage to New York, and was stranded there absolutely
penniless, although money would come at almost any hour from his
brother.
<p>Besides this, he showed me letters from editors who had taken
work which would be paid for on publication.
<p>"I do not know any one here," the young man said, "and to-day,
when I used my last twenty-five cents, I thought of you in
desperation.
<p>"Your acquaintance with my brother would serve as an
introduction, I felt, and I was confident you would realize my
straits when I told you my errand."
<p>Of course I lent the young man five dollars. "I am sure it must
be a great humiliation for you to ask for this," I said, "and I am
certain you will repay it, though many former experiences have made
me question the memory of friends and strangers to whom I have been
of similar assistance."
<p>One week later the young man called to tell me he had not been
able to do more than keep himself sustained at lunch-counters since
he called, but hoped soon to obtain a position on a daily
newspaper.
<p>That was ten years ago. The young man sat in an orchestra chair
the other night at the theatre directly in front of me, and his
attire was faultlessly up to date. From the costume of his
companion, I should judge their carriage waited outside.
<p>The young man did not seem to recognize me, and no doubt the
incident I mention has escaped his memory.
<p>In all probability I was but one of a score of people who helped
him with small loans. Had the young man had been forced to appeal
to the society organized in every city for aiding the deserving
poor, by being sent disappointed from my door, the ordeal would
have so hurt his pride, that he might not have become the
professional borrower he undoubtedly is.
<p>I could relate innumerable cases of a similar nature. One man,
who was a fashionable teacher of French among the millionaires of
New York for several seasons, appealed to me at a time of year when
all his patrons were out of the city for a loan to enable him to
give his wife medical treatment.
<p>He was to repay it in the autumn. Instead, he came to me then
with a much more distressing story of immediate need and seeming
proof of money coming to him in a few months. To my chagrin, the
loan I advanced was employed in giving a feast to friends at his
daughter's wedding, after which he obliterated himself from my
vision.
<p>Financial aid lent a woman who soon afterward circled Europe,
brought no reimbursement. Her handsomely engraved card, with the
"Russell Square Hotel, London," as address, reached me instead of
the interest money which perhaps paid the engraver.
<p>Money lent a young man to start a small business, was used for
his wedding expenses, and an interval of five years brings no word
from him. Poor and despicable beings indeed, become the victims of
the borrowing habit. It is the shattered faith in humanity, and the
heart hurts that I regret, rather than the loss of what can be
replaced. I tell you these incidents that you may realize how I
have come to regard money-lending, as a species of unkindness to a
friend or relative.
<p>It is only one step removed from giving a sick or overtaxed man
or woman a morphine powder.
<p>Sleep and rest ensue, but ten to one the habit is formed for
life.
<p>The happy experiences of my life in money-lending, have been two
instances where I offered loans which were not asked, and which
proved to be bridges over the chasm of temporary misfortune, to the
success awaiting a worthy woman and man. The really deserving
rarely ask for loans.
<p>I can imagine with what pleasure you would take a cheque from
this letter, for the amount which would carry you through college.
<p>Yet when you had finished your course, you would find so many
things you wanted to do, and must do, the debt would become too
heavy to lift, save by borrowing from some one else.
<p>If not that, then you would impose upon the fact of our
relationship, and on your belief that I had plenty of means without
the amount you owed me: and so you would join the great army of
good-for-nothings in the world.
<p>There is one thing you must always remember:
<p>No matter how close the blood tie between two beings, even
twins, each soul comes into the world alone, and with a separate
life destiny to work out.
<p>If I have worked out my destiny to financial independence, that
does not entitle you to a share of it. If it seems best for me to
aid you, it is not because a blood tie makes it a duty. I grow to
believe there is a sort of curse on money which is not earned, even
when it is bestowed by father, on son or daughter.
<p>It cripples individual development. Only when money is earned is
it blest.
<p>Regarding your future profession, I cannot agree with your idea
that because you feel no particular love for any one calling, and
have a halfway tendency toward several, that you will never be a
success. Great geniuses are often consumed with a passion for some
one line of study or employment, but there have been many great men
who did not know what they were fitted to do until accident or
necessity gave them an opportunity.
<p>Success means simply concentration and perseverance.
<p>Whether you decide to be a mechanic, a lawyer, a doctor, or a
merchant, the one thing to do is to fix all your mental powers upon
the goal you select, and then call all the forces from within and
from without, to aid you to reach it.
<p>It would, of course, be folly for you to select a profession
which requires special talent. No matter how you might concentrate
and apply yourself, you could never be a great poet, a great
artist, or a great musician.
<p>You have not the creative genius.
<p>But law, medicine, mechanics, or mercantile matters, with your
good brain and fair education, you could conquer.
<p>You say you vacillate from one to another, like the wind which
goes to the four points of the compass in twenty-four hours.
<p>But you are very young, and this should not discourage you.
<p>It would be well to think the four vocations over quietly, when
alone, and sit down by yourself early in the morning asking for
guidance. Then, when you feel you have made a decision, let nothing
turn you from it.
<p>Direct all your studies and thoughts to further that decision.
<p>Think of yourself as achieving the very highest success in your
chosen field, and work for that end.
<p>You cannot fail.
<p>If you desire light from without upon the best path to pursue, I
would advise you to find a good phrenologist, and have a careful
reading made of your head. Its formation and the development of its
organs would indicate in what direction lay your greatest strength,
and where you needed to be especially watchful.
<p>But remember if your phrenologist tells you that you have a weak
will, it does not mean that you must necessarily <i>always</i> have
a weak will. It means that you are to strengthen it, by
concentration. There is a great truth underlying phrenology,
palmistry, and astrology; but it is ridiculous to accept their
verdicts as final and unchangeable, and it is unwise to ignore the
good they may do, rightly applied and understood.
<p>I recall the fact that you were born in early June. I know
enough about the influence of the planets upon a child born at that
period to assert that you are particularly inclined to a Gemini
nature&mdash;the twin nature, which wants to do two things at one time.
You want to stay in and go out, to read a book and play tennis, to
swim and sit on the sand. Later in life, you will want to remain
single and marry, and travel and remain at home, unless you begin
<i>now</i> to select one course of the two which are for ever
presenting themselves to you, in small and large matters.
<p>Whenever you feel yourself vacillating between two impulses,
take yourself at once in hand, decide upon the preferable course,
and go ahead. Dominate your astrological tendencies, do not be
dominated by them. Dominate your weaknesses as exhibited by your
phrenological chart, and build up the brain cells which need
strengthening, and lessen the power of the undesirable qualities by
giving them no food or indulgence.
<p>It is a great thing to understand yourself as you are, and then
to go ahead and make yourself what you desire to be.
<p>When a carpenter starts to build a house, he knows just what
tools and what materials to work with are his. If there is a broken
implement, he replaces it with another, and if he is short of
material he supplies it. But young men set forth to make futures
and fortunes, with no knowledge of their own equipment.
<p>They do not know their own strongest or weakest traits, and are
unprepared for the temptations and obstacles that await them.
<p>I would advise you to call in the aid of all the occult
sciences, to help you in forming an estimate of your own higher and
lower tendencies, and in deciding for what line of occupation you
were best fitted. Then, after you have compared the statistics so
gathered with your own idea of yourself, you should proceed to make
your character what you wish it to be.
<p>This work will be ten thousand times more profitable to you than
a mere routine of college studies, gained by running in debt.
<p>To know yourself is far better knowledge than to know Virgil.
And to make yourself is a million times better than to have any one
else make you.

<a name="To_Miss_Elsie_Dean"></a>
<h2>To Miss Elsie Dean</h2>
<p class="c3">Regarding the Habit of Exaggeration<br>
<p>During your visit here with my niece, I became much interested
in you.
<p>Zoe had often written me of her affection for you, and I can
readily understand her feeling, now that I have your personal
acquaintance.
<p>You have no mother, and your father, you say, absorbed in
business, like so many American fathers, seems almost a stranger.
Even the most devoted fathers, rarely understand their daughters.
<p>Now, I want to take the part of a mother and write you to-day,
as I would write my own daughter, had one been bestowed upon me
with the many other blessings which are mine.
<p>I could not ask for a fairer, more amiable, or brighter daughter
than you, nor one possessed of a kinder or more unselfish nature.
<p>You are lovable, entertaining, industrious, and refined.
<p>But you possess one fault which needs eradicating, or at least a
propensity which needs directing.
<p><i>It is the habit of exaggeration in conversation</i>.
<p>I noticed that small happenings, amusing or exciting, became
events of colossal importance when related by you.
<p>I noticed that brief remarks were amplified and grew into
something like orations when you repeated them.
<p>I confess that you made small incidents more interesting, and
insignificant words acquired poetic meaning under your tongue.
<p>And I confess also that you never once wronged or injured any
one by your exaggerations&mdash;save yourself.
<p>Zoe often said to me, "Isn't it wonderful how Elsie's
imagination lends a halo to the commonest event," and all your
friends know that you have this habit of hyperbole in conversation.
<p>Now, in your early girlhood, it is lightly regarded as "Elsie's
way." Later, in your maturity, I fear it will be called a harsher
name.
<p>When you come to the time of life that larger subjects than
girlish pranks and badinage engage your mind, it will be necessary
for you to be more exact in your descriptions of occurrences and
conversations. Besides this, there is the heritage of your unborn
children to consider. I once knew a little girl who possessed the
same vivid imagination, and allowed it to continue unchecked
through life. She married, and her son, to-day, is utterly devoid
of fine moral senses. He is a mental monstrosity&mdash;incapable of
telling the truth. His falsehoods are many and varied, and his name
is a synonym of untruth. He relates, as truth, the most marvellous
exploits in which he really never took part, and describes scenes
and places he has never visited, save through the pages of some
novel.
<p>His lack of moral sense has blighted his mother's life, and she
is wholly unconscious that he is only an exaggerated edition of
herself.
<p>I think, as a rule, such imaginations as you possess belong to
the literary mind. I would advise you to turn your attention to
story-writing, and in that occupation you will find vent for your
romantic tendencies.
<p>Meanwhile watch yourself and control your speech.
<p>Learn to be exact.
<p>Tell the truth in small matters, and do not allow yourself to
indulge in seemingly harmless white lies of exaggeration.
<p>There are times when we should refrain from speaking all the
truth, but we should refrain by silence or an adroit change of
subject. We should not feel called upon to relate all the
unpleasant truths we know of people.
<p>When asked what we know of some acquaintance, we are justified
in telling the worthy and commendable traits, and saying nothing of
the faults.
<p>Therefore, while to suppress a portion of the truth is at times
wise and kind, to distort it, or misstate facts, is never needed
and never excusable.
<p>When you and Zoe came from your drive one day you were full of
excitement over an adventure with a Greek road merchant.
<p>As you told the story, the handsome peddler had accosted you at
the exit of the post-office and asked you to look at his wares.
<p>When you declined he became familiar, paid a compliment to Zoe's
beauty, and assured her that a certain lace shawl in his possession
would be irresistible draped about her face.
<p>Then he had pursued the carriage on his wheel and continued to
"make eyes" and pay compliments to the very gate of my home, where
he abandoned the chase.
<p>The facts were, according to further investigation, that the man
paid a simple trade compliment in reference to the shawl and its
becomingness to a pretty face, mounted his wheel and rode away, as
it happened, in the same direction you and Zoe were taking.
<p>Again, you related a bit of repartee between Zoe and a caller,
which I had chanced to over-hear, and out of two short sentences
you made a small brochure, most amusing, but most untrue.
<p>It was complimentary to both Zoe and her caller, yet it was not
the conversation which took place, and therefore was not truthful.
<p>These are trifling incidents, yet they are the straws, telling
that the wind blows from the marsh-lands of inexactness&mdash;not from
the mountain tops of truth.
<p>Once a woman loses a sense of the great value of absolute
truthfulness, she has blurred the clear mirror of her soul.
<p>Put yourself upon a diet of <i>facts</i>, my sweet young friend,
and cure this propensity, harmless enough now, but dangerous for
your future.
<p>Watch your tongue that it does not say <i>five or six</i> when
it should say <i>two</i>, or <i>yards</i> when it should say
<i>inches</i>.
<p>Even in the smallest matters, practise the habit of being exact.
<p>You will thank me for this advice sometime, even if it seems
unreasonable to you to-day, and remember, I would not take the
liberty or the trouble to so advise you, did I not love you and
feel anxious for your welfare.

<h2>To Sybyl Marchmont</h2>
<p class="c3">Who Has Learned Her Origin<br>
<p>Your despairing letter lies before me. I wish you were here, my
dear child, that I might talk from my heart, instead of writing
from it. I am sorry that the secret, so long hidden, has been
revealed to you, and in such a despicable manner.
<p>An anonymous letter always carries with it the venom of a
serpent. I have long known your history, though the world generally
believed you to be the actual daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Marchmont,
who adopted you when you were scarcely one week old.
<p>No daughter ever received more affection or better care than
these good people gave you. Mrs. Marchmont lived always with a fear
in her heart that you might learn your history from some idle or
malicious lip, and before she died begged me to be your comforting
friend, if that hour ever came, which has now arrived.
<p>As your mother's nearest friend, it is natural you should turn
to me in your crucial hour of pain. And in reply to your questions
regarding the truth of this anonymous assertion, I will tell you
all I know.
<p>Your own mother was well born, and a girl of great beauty and
charm. She was of foreign blood, and her parents, after the foreign
custom, selected for her, at the age of seventeen, a man of mature
years and unattractive personality, but some fortune. The family
lived in a seaport town, and your mother attracted the eye of a
young seafaring man, holding a government position. An intense and
uncontrollable love sprang up between them. Your mother had been
kept in ignorance of God's great law of sex attraction, its purpose
and its results, and she was like a new-born babe towed on the sea
of her own suddenly awakened emotion.
<p>It was arranged that your mother was to elope with her lover on
his next arrival in port. All plans were to be made by him during
the voyage on which he went forth, after a stolen interview with
your mother. He was lost at sea, and all on board the ship perished
with him. Mr. and Mrs. Marchmont chanced to be sojourning in the
place at the time of your birth. Mr. Marchmont had longed for a
child, and the tragic story came to his ears through the physician
of your mother's family, and he and his wife decided to adopt you
and take you to America.
<p>I was the one friend who shared with Mrs. Marchmont the story of
your birth. Other friends knew she had adopted a child, and of
course all sorts of rumours were afloat for a time. Mr. Marchmont's
nephew was particularly unfriendly, I remember, as he had believed
himself heir to his uncle's estate until your adoption.
<p>Some three years ago I chanced to be in the seaport town where
you were born, and I made quiet inquiries about your mother. I
learned that she had recently died, leaving a husband and three
children. I hunted up the children, and found them to be most
uninteresting and ordinary. The oldest daughter I met and studied.
She was plain and commonplace in appearance, and the other children
were dull and unattractive.
<p>The husband was the elderly man selected by your grandparents.
Just how he had been led to accept the second place in your
mother's life, and whether he had known of the tragedy, I could not
learn without asking more questions than I deemed wise.
<p>But what I want to impress upon your mind by this recital is,
<i>your own divine inheritance of love,</i> the inheritance which
has bestowed upon you physical beauty, mental power, and rare
qualities of heart and soul. I know few women so endowed by the
Creator as you. I know of few young girls&mdash;in fact, not one&mdash;I would
so gladly and proudly claim as a daughter, or wish a daughter to be
like, as your lovely self.
<p>When I read your letter, with its wild expressions of
self-abasement and despair and regret that you were in the world,
where, you seemed to believe, you had no right to be, I could not
help picturing to myself the dull face and disagreeable personality
of your half-sister, the child whom you no doubt believe has a
greater right than yourself on earth. Now whatever society has
decided is legal and right for human beings, you must not forget
that God also has made rules, and that those rules must first be
obeyed, before the rules of man can be regarded as perfect.
<p>God's first law, regarding the propagation of the human species,
is that the <i>mother must be dominated by a supreme and ruling
emotion to give to the world the highest type of a child</i>.
<p>Your mother loved your father with all her heart and soul. She
was a young girl, ignorant of the world. She thought of her lover
as her rightful mate, and lived but for the hour when he should
rescue her from the unhappy fate arranged by unwise and
sordid-minded parents.
<p>Your father loved her, and they were in God's sight more truly
husband and wife than the soulless and loveless ceremony of the law
made her and her legal husband afterward.
<p>It is a great misfortune that your parents lacked the
self-control which is necessary to every well-balanced human being
who seeks for the fullest development. It is a sad thing that over
your life this shadow of unlegalized birth must rest.
<p>But were I given the choice to-day to be what you are, or what
your sister is, and what thousands of children born of loveless
marriages are, I would not for one second hesitate in my choice.
<p>The world needs marriage laws to keep any order in society.
<p>The wisely reared and well-balanced woman will keep herself in
womanly reserve for her legal husband.
<p>Your mother, by a moment's weakness and loss of self-control,
left a blight upon her life for ever, and a shadow upon yours.
<p>But do not for one instant think of yourself as anything but
<i>a child of God</i>, endowed with all the wealth of the spiritual
kingdom, whatever the law may withhold from you here.
<p>You are legitimized by love, your sister is legitimate by law.
She is illegitimate in the sight of heaven, you in sight of earth.
<p>Be glad of your beautiful nature and beautiful qualities, and do
not spoil them by despondency or pessimism.
<p>Think of yourself as if you were a child of Adam and Eve, born
before the serpent appeared, when there was no law but the law of
love to govern two souls, drawn together by irresistible
attraction.
<p>The best and highest qualities of two human beings meet and
mingle in your nature. Do you suppose the great Creator of all
things regards you as base born, when he has so endowed you with
all that makes woman lovable and charming.
<p>Live up to your divine inheritance, my dear girl. Make the world
better for your presence in it, and bear your sorrow with that
resignation and philosophy which all human beings must cultivate if
they do not wish to become weak repiners when they face the sorrows
of life.
<p>Look the world squarely in the eyes, and feel no shame.
<p>Your mother's marriage to the man she detested, and the birth of
children conceived in loathing, were acts which in my mind called
for more shame on her part than your own birth. Both were
misfortunes for her, since only by living an orderly, controlled,
and lawful life can any human being find happiness or self-respect
in the world.
<p>But when we come to the close analysis of motives and impulses,
many an act the world condemns is far less reprehensible than other
acts which meet its loud acclaim.
<p>You have received from the vast spiritual realms about us your
rarely beautiful qualities. Go forth and give them to humanity.
<p>Be strong, be good, be brave, be happy.
<p>No one and nothing can harm you but your own mind.
<p>The world, as we encounter it, is but an echo of our own strong
convictions. Respect yourself absolutely, believe in yourself
absolutely, and the world will respect you and believe in you.
<p>Say to yourself every hour, "I am God's divine creature," and no
one will dare look you in the eyes and say you are anything less
than that.
<p>The arms of infinite love enfold you&mdash;have no fear.

<h2>To Miss Diana Rivers</h2>
<p class="c3">Young Lady Contemplating a Career as a Journalist<br>
<p>Your interesting letter regarding your future plans has been
food for my thoughts ever since its receipt this morning.
<p>I remember when you were my guest a year ago that you told me
you felt like a big bird in a small cage. Every time you tried to
spread your wings you were bruised by bars. Your home environment
with its few duties and small responsibilities, your church and
your charities, failed to give you full opportunity for the
exercise of all your vital forces.
<p>I knew then that you were longing for a career, and I felt
confident that some word would come from you before long,
announcing a change in your life.
<p>I was prepared to hear one of two things&mdash;that you were soon to
be married, or that you had decided to enter the dramatic
profession. When a young and attractive woman grows restless and
eager for change, she is, unconsciously to herself, sending out a
challenge to Fate to create new conditions in her life. Despite the
fact that no male member in the "Fate" family has ever attained
prominence in the eyes of the world, and that the three sisters
have claimed so much power over the destinies of the human family,
a little investigation will prove that they never make any
pronounced move without calling in the aid of Cupid.
<p>Cupid is their prime minister, and we all know that prime
ministers are the power behind the throne of rulers.
<p>When you sent out your eager thoughts for "something to happen,"
to change the monotony of your existence, I knew the Fate sisters
were quite likely telegraphing Cupid that his assistance was needed
to quiet a small riot in the human family.
<p>Once they set Cupid busy with a human heart, the Fates need give
it no further attention. When Cupid reports that his work with the
heart is finished, then the Angel of Resignation or the Angel of
Death must finish the task.
<p>Knowing you to be particularly fond of the theatre as a
distraction, I had thought you might essay the r&ocirc;le of
society actress, confounding appreciation for talent, as so many
women do; and when your letter opened with the announcement that
you were about to give me a great surprise, I was prepared to hear
that you were billed to appear in a walking r&ocirc;le, with a road
company, next season, with promises of greater things "soon
afterward."
<p>But I confess to absolute surprise, as I read on, and learned
that your career was to lead you, not through Lovers' Lane, not
before the footlights, but along the hurly-burly byways and
highways of American newspaper work, beginning with interviews and
reporting. Allow me to quote from your letter before me.
<p>"I do not imagine I have talent save the talent for work. I am,
as you know, well educated, as that expression goes to-day. I have
always found expression with the pen an easy mode of communicating
my impressions and ideas.
<p>"I am observing, and I have a keen sense of humour, and I have
(so people tell me) an agreeable personality. I know the value of
correct dressing, and I am not oversensitive. That is, I am not one
who will go down at the first rebuff. I have the real American
spirit, which makes me believe myself as good as anybody, and you
know my family name is one to buoy up that impression. Therefore,
it seems to me I cannot fail to attain some degree of success. I am
sure to obtain entr&eacute;e to people and functions, and I can
describe what I see and hear in attractive form. I shall shrink at
no task, however difficult, and stop at no obstacle.
<p>"I am determined to make a success as a reporter and a
correspondent, and after I have achieved something in that line I
may look to an editorial position; and who knows but my fertile
imagination, coupled with the experiences sure to come to me, may
develop the great American novelist the world is waiting?"
<p>This is all interesting and admirable reasoning.
<p>But, having seen much of the world, and known much of the
various types of young women writers and reporters and
correspondents, I feel like discussing the subject of your
profession with you. At the instigation, perhaps, of some editor
who makes the mistake of thinking success must be reached through
sensationalism, you may be tempted to make your pen, not
<i>mightier</i>, but more <i>cruel</i> than the sword.
<p>I remember once upon a time meeting a young woman who had come,
unbidden by the hostess, to "write up" a social function where a
number of celebrated people were congregated.
<p>Her employer had sent her to the house, telling her to obtain an
entree by fair means or foul; and as she was well dressed and quiet
in manner, she was not repulsed by an amiable hostess. This lady
realized that the reporter has his or her living to make, and must
be either helped or hindered by the willingness or unwillingness of
people to furnish material for copy. Being informed that the young
woman was "literary," and chancing to stand near her for a few
moments, I asked her the nature of her work.
<p>The young woman looked a trifle embarrassed, as she answered:
"Well, to tell you the truth, I write a good many disagreeable and
nasty things about people, especially people in public life. The
editors who take my work will have that kind. I have essayed better
things, and they would not touch them. So I am compelled to write
the stuff they do want. I must make a living." When I read the
"stuff" in question, I was inclined to doubt the assertion of the
writer that "she must make a living." The world would be the better
should she and all her kind cease to exist. Ridicule, falsehood,
and insinuation were the leading traits of the young woman's
literary style. Costumes and personalities were caricatured, and
conversations and actions misstated. The entire article would have
been libelous, had it not been too cowardly to deserve so bold a
word.
<p>It is useless for any man or woman to assert that such
reportorial work is done from necessity. The blackmailer and the
pickpocket have as much right to the plea, as the newspaper
masked-assassin, with the concealed weapon of a pen.
<p>If you are ever asked by any editor to do this reportorial
stiletto work, let me urge you to take to professional burglary,
rather than consent to write what such an employer demands.
<p>It is far less despicable to rob houses of things of mercantile
value, than to rob characters and reputations and personalities.
Again, when you are sent out upon a commission to obtain an
interview with any person, obtain what you seek and take nothing
else away with you.
<p>Just as you would scorn to pawn the watch of the famous actress
which you may find lying on the table as you pass out, so scorn to
sell any personal speech she may have carelessly dropped in your
hearing which you know was not intended for publication. Petty
larceny is not a noble feature of interviewing. Even though a
facility for selling such dishonestly gained property to advantage
be yours, do not convince yourself or be convinced that larceny
should be included in your reportorial duties.
<p>I recollect speaking with you once upon the difficulties young
women encountered who attempted to win honours in a dramatic
career. You felt that the necessity to cater to the ideas and
wishes of inferior minds, in representing a character on the stage,
would be one of the hardest phases of stage life to meet.
<p>"To be loud and spectacular where I wanted to be refined and
subtle," you said, "just to catch some rough audience and fill the
house, would be insupportable. And yet I know actresses ofttimes
must do that very thing, to keep a foothold in the profession."
<p>I am wondering how you will meet what seems to me a more
humiliating r&ocirc;le, when you are sent out by an editor to gain
an entree to some person who does not wish to be interviewed.
<p>Will you, when refused entrance at the front door, go in at the
rear and hobnob with the servants? will you spy, and watch and wait
on street corners, and hide yourself in hallways, and intercept and
surprise, and congratulate yourself when you have trapped your
prey? That is the shameful pathway which nowadays leads to what is
called "successful newspaper work."
<p>You need to realize the facts before you enter the profession.
Were you my daughter, I am certain I should feel much less concern
were you to enter the theatrical field.
<p>And yet if you choose to stand by your ideals, and retain your
self-respect, you can do so, and succeed in journalism.
<p>If you have, as you say, observation, expression, humour, and
ambition, you can create a style of your own: which will not
necessitate the loss of all womanly sense of decency and pride in
dealing with your fellow beings. It might be well for you to
cultivate and add to the list of your qualities appreciation of all
that is best in human nature and worthiest of respect. If you
understand the law of concentration and demand, you can obtain an
entrance to the people you wish to see, through the front hall and
a properly engraved card.
<p>If that fails, a polite and frank note, stating your purpose and
intimating your self-respecting ideas of your profession, may prove
effective. Once establish your reputation as an interviewer who is
not a highwayman in disguise, and you will achieve tenfold the
success your less reputable confr&egrave;res gain in the long run.
Try and remember always that fame, glory, or even crime, do not
destroy all human sensibilities, or render the possessor
invulnerable to the thrust of a pen.
<p>The greatest warrior who ever conquered armies has still the
power to feel hurt when he sees some personal blemish or misfortune
described in print.
<p>You would never be guilty of saying to any man's face, "How
hideous your harelip renders you"&mdash;and why should you go from his
presence and make such a statement to the whole world concerning
him? One of the most gifted men America ever claimed was driven
from his native land by the cruel, bald, and heartless
personalities of newspaper critics, who seemed to consider it
necessary to comment on his physical infirmities whenever his
genius was mentioned.
<p>During the lifetime of one of England's great literary women, an
American correspondent who had been given an interview in her home
described her as possessing the "face of a horse." Surely this was
agreeable reading for a gifted woman whose genius had delighted
thousands!
<p>It has sometimes seemed to me that theatrical road life with a
one-night-stand company would be less brutalizing to the finer
sensibilities, and less lowering to the ideals of a young girl,
than the method of work required of many newspaper reporters in
America to-day. The editor who scores the actress for lax morals
seems often to ignore the fact that there is a mental as well as a
physical prostitution.
<p>Look to it that you do not trail your banner of noble womanhood
in the dust, at the demand of any editor or syndicate. Keep your
purity of pen, as well as your chastity of body, and believe no man
who tells you that you will get on better in the world by selling
either. There is room higher up.

<a name="To_Nanette"></a>
<h2>To Nanette</h2>
<p class="c3">A Former Maid<br>
<p>Curiously enough, my dear little Nanette, I was thinking about
you, and wishing to know something of you, the very day your letter
came.
<p>Of many who have been helpers in my employ, you were one of the
few who seemed to care more for me than for the wages I paid.
<p>There was between us that ideal condition which I wish might
exist between all employers and employees. You wanted the work you
were fitted to do, and I wanted such work done. You were glad of
the money it brought you, and I was glad to recompense you. You
wanted appreciation and sympathy and consideration aside from your
earnings, and I wanted a personal interest in my affairs, and a
friendly wish to please me, aside from the mere work well done. You
never seemed to me less womanly or less refined because you were a
wage-earner, and I did not represent to you oppression or monopoly
merely because I paid the money and you received it. I took you
into my confidence in many ways, and you made me feel I was your
friend as well as your employer. We enjoyed cosy chats, and yet you
no more desired or wished to be present at my social functions than
you desired me to enter into all your merrymakings and pleasures.
You were, in fact, one of the most agreeable and sensible women I
have ever known in any station in life. And now you write me that
you are engaged to be married, and ask me to give you counsel in a
very serious matter.
<p>Together with your other excellent qualities, you have possessed
economy and prudence.
<p>At the age of twenty-five you have a tidy bank-account, the
savings of eleven years. This money is increasing, year by year,
and drawing a small interest.
<p>Now comes your lover, a hard-working and sober young man, so you
say, but earning only a small salary as a clerk.
<p>He has met with some reverses, and is temporarily embarrassed.
He wants you to lend him a few hundred dollars, and he will pay you
the same interest you are now receiving, but you fear it would be
unwomanly on your part to take this interest money. At the same
time you feel a reluctance to break in upon your savings, which you
had planned to use in helping establish a home. You want to
befriend your lover, and you want to be wise and careful, and so
you write to me, your old-time adviser, for counsel. I fear I may
hurt your feelings in what I am about to say.
<p>I have seen much of the world, and have studied humanity in many
phases and in many classes.
<p>There is one type of man I have never yet known to be strong,
reliable, and trustworthy,&mdash;a man for a woman to lean upon in times
of trouble and sorrow,&mdash;a man I would like to see any friend take
for a life companion,&mdash;<i>and that is the young man who asks a loan
of money from a woman he loves, or one who loves him</i>. Believe
me, there is some lack of real moral fibre in such a man.
<p>A husband and wife many years married, and united by common
interests, may become so one in purpose and thought that a common
purse would be as natural to them as a common dinner-table.
<p>With mutual interests, planning for their future and the future
of their children, there could be no talk of "My money" and "Your
money" between them.
<p>But before marriage, or immediately after, the man who begins to
ask a woman for the use of her purse, should be distrusted by her.
He could not broach such a subject unless he lacked a certain
refined strength which makes a manly man a woman's protector by
nature. Even where no sentiment exists between a man and a woman,
the really strong men of the world never become borrowers from
women. If through friendly interest and affection some woman
compelled such a man to take a loan, he would know no rest or peace
of mind until he had liquidated the debt.
<p>When a man is a woman's lover, and asks her to advance money to
him for any reason, she may as well realize at once the reed on
which she will lean if she accepts him for a life companion. To
deceive herself for a moment with the idea that he will be a staff
of strength, is but to delay disillusion. A vital quality is left
out of his character.
<p>He is but one step removed from the man who <i>seeks</i> a woman
because she has money. And he is the most despicable of the human
race.
<p>I have known three women of different social positions to lend
money to their lovers.
<p>One man invested it and lost it, and never made an effort to
reimburse the lady, who broke her engagement in consequence, after
two unhappy years. Another went away owing the money, and was never
again heard from. The third married the unwise woman who had loaned
him her competence, and continued to look to her for support.
<p>Therefore, my dear Nanette, I would urge you to think twice, and
yet a third time, before you lend your fianc&eacute; your savings.
<p>Tell him frankly that you will feel more respect for him if he
is willing to sacrifice comfort and save from his own income enough
to lift the debt he has incurred, and that you are sure he will
feel less humiliated as time goes by if he is not financially in
debt to you. If he were to fall ill tell him it would be your first
impulse to devote your money to his care; but while he is
able-bodied and well, you do not like to have him lean on you for
aid.
<p>You can judge something of the man's character by the way he
receives this statement from you.
<p>And whatever may result, even if it is the end of your
engagement, do not grieve your heart away over it. Better far to
have the end come now than to marry a dependent and shiftless man,
who will humiliate your pride by a thousand and one mean traits.
The moment a young wife becomes the financial head of a household,
and the man depends upon her to keep the family free from debt,
sentiment and romance fly from the windows of the heart, and poor
Cupid goes away with his head under his wing. This situation might
befall people long married, as I said before, without causing
disaster, because the wife would have years of other experiences
stored up in memory, to maintain her respect for her husband.
<p>The natural instinct of a manly man is to be the protector and
the breadwinner. He loves to shield and support the woman of his
choice. If she has any talent or profession which gives her
satisfaction to pursue, and which yields her an income, he will, if
broad-minded and sympathetic, place no obstacle in her path so long
as this vocation is no barrier to their domestic happiness. But he
is sensitive to her assuming any of the financial burdens of life.
<p>If circumstances render it necessary for her to do so, he
suffers keenly, and the utmost delicacy and consideration on her
part alone can save him from utter humiliation.
<p>This is the attitude of the manly man, my dear Nanette, the man
who makes the good husband and father.
<p>The unselfish, broad-minded and considerate wife will lead a
husband to think of her right to aid in the establishment and
maintenance of a home when she is able to do her part. But the man
who makes a good husband never suggests it as her duty, or asks her
to advance money.
<p>It is commendable in you to wish to aid in making a home. It is
unmanly in your lover to ask you to help him pay his debts. Beware
of the lover who asks for or accepts a loan.
<hr class="c2">
<a name="To_The_Rev_Wilton_Marsh"></a>
<h2>To The Rev. Wilton Marsh</h2>
<p class="c3">Regarding His Son and Daughter<br>
<p>My dear Cousin Wilton:&mdash;You have no idea how your letter took me
back to my merry girlhood, when you and I resided in the same
neighbourhood, and I was the concern of your precociously serious
mind. Yes, indeed, I do realize what a mistake you made in living
the repressed life you did all those early boyhood years. What a
pity your parents reared one of your sensitive and imaginative
nature in the gloomy old doctrines of a depressing religion, which
so misrepresented the God of love: and how odd that your father and
mine should have been born of the same parents, educated in the
same schools, and yet be no more alike in beliefs or methods of
life than two people of a different race and era.
<p>And again it is not strange, when we realize that hundreds of
generations lie back of both parents, and innumerable ancestors of
both father and mother contribute their different mentalities to
the children in a family. Back of that is the great philosophy of
reincarnation&mdash;the truth of which impresses me more and more each
year I live.
<p>Do you recall your horror the first time I told you I had read a
book on reincarnation, and confessed that it had made me anxious to
study the theory?
<p>You said I was a pagan and a heathen, and that I would surely be
damned forever unless I turned to the way of salvation.
<p>And do you recall your misery when I seized you one evening at
your birthday party (you were twenty), and dragged you about the
room in a waltz? That is, I waltzed, while you hobbled about like a
lame calf, much to the amusement of most of the company.
<p>There were more who sympathized with my views of life than with
yours. You were such a wet blanket on our youthful spirits. Your
ever-blazing lake of brimstone did not even serve to warm the
blanket.
<p>I have been gratified to watch your growth the last ten years.
<p>You have so changed your point of view, which indicates your
real worth and progressive good sense. And when you tell me that
you have for years regretted your lost opportunities for natural
and moral pleasure, and that you suffered beyond your power to
describe in those old days in conquering your desire to dance and
play games, it brings the tears of mingled rage and pity to my
eyes. Rage at the old theology, and pity for the poor children
whose lives were shadowed by it.
<p>And now what you tell me of your son and daughter proves another
of my theories true, and shows me how nature revenges its wrongs.
<p>Children, my dear Wilton, especially the offspring of strong
characters, <i>inherit the suppressed tendencies of their
parents</i>. They bring into action the unexhausted impulses and
the ungratified desires of those parents.
<p>The greatest singers are almost invariably the offspring of
mothers or fathers who <i>were music hungry</i>, and who were given
no complete gratification of this craving.
<p>The poet, you will find, is the voice of an artistic-natured
parent, who was forced to be emotionally dumb.
<p>And the proverbial clergyman's son is merely the natural result
of the same cause. He is charged with the tendencies and impulses
which his father crucified.
<p>That your son loathes study, and hates church-going, and adores
a brass band and a circus, and runs away to the races, does not in
the least surprise me. Nor that your sixteen-year-old daughter
grows hysterical at the sound of dance music, and prefers a
theatrical show in your village hall to a Sunday-school picnic, and
is mad to become an actress.
<p class="c3">They are your own wronged and starved emotions
personified, and crying out to you for justice.
<p>The very best thing for you to do with the boy is to put him
into a gymnasium and a football team as soon as possible. Offer no
opposition when he wants to see a good horse-race. Urge him to go,
and ask him to tell you all about it when he returns. Begin right
now to get close to the heart of your children.
<p>Once you do that, once you convince them you are near enough to
their lives to understand their needs and to try and gratify their
natural longings, all your worries will take wing and fly away; for
your children will cease to hide and cloak their actions and
natures, and they will no longer wish to deceive or attempt to defy
you.
<p>Send your daughter where she can learn dancing, in company with
other refined and well-bred young people. You have so far
emancipated yourself from your old superstitions and beliefs that
this action on your part will not antagonize the desirable members
of your congregation.
<p>Only a remnant of the old bigots and intolerants are to be found
in any congregation of intelligent people of to-day.
<p>If that remnant is shaken out of its winding-sheet by being
antagonized, you may galvanize it into life.
<p>At all events, do not endanger the peace of your home and the
happiness of your children, for fear of antagonizing a few
parishioners of arrested spiritual development.
<p>Give your son and daughter an outlet for the youthful vitality
which is like steam: a moving power when used, dangerous and
destructive when pent up.
<p>Take young Wilton and Rebecca into a room, and talk the whole
matter over.
<p>Tell them how deeply you love them, and how you have just come
to realize the mistake you have made in trying to eradicate from
them the natural desire for wholesome pleasure instead of giving it
proper avenues of expression.
<p>Say frankly that you see your error, and that you intend to
rectify it.
<p>Ask their co&ouml;peration, and appeal to their good taste and
affection not to mortify or humiliate you in your position of
clergyman, by overstepping the bounds of decorum or discretion.
<p>Lead them to talk of their ambitions and desires, and, as
consistently as you can, gratify them.
<p>Let your daughter come to me for a season. I will help to
reshape and modify her ideals of enjoyment to some degree.
<p>I am sure if she sees a few of our best spectacular plays, and
hears good music, and enjoys beautiful rhythmic dancing, she will
not be so carried away with the travelling show.
<p>I will acquaint her with some of the commonplace facts
concerning the lives of theatrical people, and show her the frayed
tinsel and worn faces by daylight. This will do more for her than
all your sermons on the dangers of a theatrical career.
<p>The young heart is fascinated with the thought of danger and
temptation.
<p>It is repelled by the commonplace and the ugly.
<p>When you talk to a young mind in a whisper and behind locked
doors about a temptation to be avoided, you but give edge to
appetite and curiosity.
<p>When you bring the temptation out into the glare of sunlight,
and speak of it in presence of the whole world, you dispel the
illusion.
<p>I will gather together some data concerning the sporting men of
America, and send your son. I will also mail him the sporting
papers regularly. Let him talk and read openly about the subject,
and it will lose half its weird charm.
<p>He, too, should learn to dance, swim, fence, and ride. His
bounding vitality needs directing in wholesome channels. I have
never understood the prejudice against dancing.
<p>To me, it is a form of religious praise of the Creator of youth,
health, vitality, and grace. I have always loved dancing, and the
exercise, besides being eminently beneficial to the health and
wonderfully conducive to grace is, to my thinking, highly moral in
its effect. Its only danger lies in wrong associations, and these
seem to threaten young people who are restricted from the enjoyment
in their homes and among their rightful companions.
<p>I cannot help thinking that Loie Fuller should have a niche in
the hall of fame, among the "Immortals," for having given the last
century her exquisitely beautiful creations in dancing.
<p>No woman has given us a great epic, or a great painting, or a
great musical composition, but she has given us a great dance-poem,
which is at the same time a painting and a song. Oh, you poor
starved, blind soul, to be deprived of such beautiful spectacles.
How I pity you, and how I pray you to give your children the
privileges you have missed through a belittling idea of your
Creator.
<p>Do you fancy God would punish beautiful young Rebecca for
dancing, any sooner than he would blight the willow-tree for waving
its graceful arms to the tune the wind-harps play?
<p>Come up out of the jungles of ignorance and bigotry, my dear
cousin, and live on the hilltops and bring your children with you.
For there you will all find yourself nearer to God and to humanity.

<h2>To Mrs. Charles McAllister</h2>
<p class="c3">Formerly Miss Winifred Clayborne<br>
<p>I am glad that for once you have written and asked my advice
before you began your course of action.
<p>You wrote me after you entered Vassar and asked me what I
thought of your doing so.
<p>You wrote me after you married Doctor McAllister, and asked me
what I thought of that. My reply was a wedding gift and a telegram
of good wishes. Now, after three years of married life, you write
again and ask me to decide a question which has caused some
discussion between you and the doctor.
<p>"He did not take my view of the matter at first," you say, "but
he does now. Still, I feel that I would like another unprejudiced
opinion before I take the contemplated step. You knew I left
college before finishing my course. I was in love and the doctor
urged me not to make him wait another year. He said I knew enough
to make him happy, and so I consented."
<p>Then you proceed to tell me that you have never regretted this
step, and that you have the best husband in the world. But you have
decided musical gifts, and before meeting the doctor you intended
going abroad to cultivate them after you finished at Vassar. This
old ambition has taken hold of you again, and you want to join a
friend, one of your classmates, who sails in June to study art in
Europe. You desire to take a two or three years' course, and then
you will be equipped with an accomplishment which could be made a
profession if necessity demanded.
<p>"One never knows what the future holds," you say, "and it is the
duty of every woman to make the most of herself." Both remarks are
as true as they are trite. An almost graduate of Vassar should be
more original in expressing herself.
<p>But there is another duty a woman should not forget&mdash;the duty to
stand by her marriage vows and to make her husband a good wife. It
seems the doctor did not eagerly approve your idea at the
beginning. I am glad he did not. Unless a wife is in a precarious
state of health or has an ailing child, I always suspect the
honesty of a husband who cheerfully seconds her suggestion of a
protracted absence from home.
<p>When a man shows no regret at having his wife away for an entire
season, there is something wrong with his heart.
<p>Love does not find its home there, or he could not speed her
going so far, and for so long a time, at the bidding of ambition or
pleasure. You evidently have won the doctor over by argument, and
made him feel that he is selfish to tie you down or clip the wings
of your ambition. The American husband is so fearful of seeming a
tyrant. "He realizes now," you say, "that a woman has the right to
develop the talents God gave her just as a man does, and that it is
a wrong against her 'higher self' to crush down these ambitions. He
realizes, too, that this separation means greater powers of
usefulness for me in the future, and greater opportunities for
pleasure. It will be a long and lonely time for both of us, as I
shall only come home once or twice and the doctor may not be able
to go over at all, though I hope he will. But the expense of my
studies will of course be great, and we shall both need to
economize. It is my intention to start a little conservatory after
I return and take a few high-priced pupils. In that way I can
reimburse our expenditure."
<p>But can you, my dear Winifred, <i>reimburse your mutual losses
in other ways</i>? You do not seem to realize what such a
separation may mean. You are both young and both attractive. I know
now that you are beginning to be angry at my suggestion, but,
fortunately, you cannot interrupt me, and you must hear what I have
to say.
<p>Of course you are not a frivolous flirt, or a silly-headed
creature with no ideals or principles. You have nothing of the
adventuress in your composition, but you are a young woman, with
personal charms and talents, and life will be unutterably desolate
for you if you make a recluse of yourself. You will be surrounded
by people of artistic temperaments and tastes, and I know, if you
do not, that many of these people do lack ideals, and some of them
lack principles and take pride in the fact. "Art for art's sake,
life for pleasure's sake," is their motto. The entire situation
will be full of danger for you. But far more danger will surround
your husband. A man's temptations are always greater than a
woman's. That is, there are <i>more</i> temptations in his pathway,
from the fact that he is by nature and environment less guarded and
protected, and the penalties for folly are less severe. And of all
men, unless it is a clergyman, a physician is most exposed to
temptation. He is the confidant of hysterical women and the sharer
of domestic secrets. Many a woman believes she is ill only because
she desires the sympathy of her doctor, just as many a woman
fancies herself disturbed with religious agitation only because she
wants the society of her minister.
<p>Of course a doctor of any character or principle does not
compromise his reputation or disgrace his calling readily. I hear
Doctor McAllister spoken of as a man of high standing, and his
picture shows a well-balanced head and an honest, manly face. But
"A man's a man for a' that," my dear Winifred.
<p>We must accept facts as they exist all about us, and we must not
demand of half-evolved human beings what we would expect of wholly
divine creatures. It is an unnatural position for a man to be
separated from the wife he loves for months and years.
<p>Unless he is sustained by intense religious beliefs, extreme
sympathy or sorrow for her (as he might be were she compelled by
some great trouble or duty to be absent), it is impossible for him
not to grow in a measure forgetful of his ideals of constancy, and
to drift into bachelor habits of distraction. Men do a thousand and
one things for amusement which no woman could or would. Gilded and
glittering halls of vice are inviting the inspection and patronage
of men who are left at home by journeying and pleasure-seeking
wives.
<p>I know this terrible statement to be absolutely
true&mdash;<i>gambling-houses and dens of infamy speak of their "best
season" when wives leave town for summer outings, just as a farmer
speaks of his harvest season when crops are ripe.</i> I do not
suppose your husband will seek the companionship of gamblers or
depraved souls during your absence. Men as seemingly high and
strong as he have fallen so low, but I do not believe he will. Yet,
so long as we know such conditions exist, and so long as men as a
class take the liberties they do when left to find distraction and
entertainment, it seems to me little less than criminal when a
young wife like yourself deliberately leaves her home and husband
for the sake of any possible attainment.
<p>You have no right to marry a man and then to make his happiness
and his comfort secondary to your ambitions.
<p>If he had neglected you, if he failed to support you, if he was
not loyal to you, it would be different.
<p>But you say he is "the best of men," and that you never have
regretted marrying him.
<p>Then let me beg of you to stand by him, as a wife should, and to
make what progress in your music you can at home, and wait until
your husband can accompany you before you go abroad to study.
<p>The highway of divorce is crowded with the student wives who
have been "abroad to study," leaving their husbands at home to earn
the money. Do not be one of them.
<p>There are greater things than a satisfied ambition, and a clean,
happy, united married life is one.

<h2>To Mrs. Charles Gordon</h2>
<p class="c3">Concerning Maternity<br>
<p>I have tried to imagine myself in your place, as you requested,
before answering your letter.
<p>To be the mother of two children, and to know that a third may
be added before the fifth anniversary of your wedding, is for the
most maternal of women a situation requiring rare patience and much
philosophy.
<p>I know that your strength is depleted, that you are nervously
unstrung, and I can understand your despondent state of mind.
<p>It seems to you that all romance and sentiment in life is being
sacrificed to breeding the species. You feel that you have some
personal privileges as a wife and a woman, not less than a mother.
<p>Like yourself, I do not believe woman's only mission in life to
be the production of offspring, yet I consider motherhood the
highest privilege accorded her who has for it the right physical
and moral qualities.
<p>Only strong, sensible, and healthy women should become mothers,
and it is a mistake for even such as they to be kept constantly in
that occupation.
<p>You possess all the requisites, and you ought to bring fine
children into the world, since you married the man you loved, and
have been happy with him.
<p>But I can understand your reluctance to pass through the ordeal
which modern motherhood in civilized races means, for a third time,
in so short a period. But try and take another view of the
situation.
<p>Benjamin Franklin was the fifteenth child of a poor tallow
chandler. It is altogether probable that his coming seemed a
misfortune to his mother, taxed with the care of such a brood.
Think what the world would have missed had he not come to earth.
<p>Then think of this unborn child as something wonderful and
divine, given to you to perfect. Believe it is to be the greatest
blessing to you and to the whole world.
<p>Cultivate love and protection in your heart for it.
<p>Tell yourself every hour of the day that the God of love will
not desert you or deprive you of strength and courage for your
ordeal. That he will be ever near, and sustain and comfort you.
<p>Desire all beautiful and good qualities to be given your child,
and resolutely turn away from the contemplation of anything that is
hideous, or unwholesome, or depressing.
<p>Look for pleasing objects, read cheerful and uplifting books,
and from infinite space call to you all ministering influences.
<p>Consider how short a time, when compared to the span of human
life, expectant motherhood occupies, and realize the vastness of
its influence upon the nature of the child, and through that nature
upon all humanity.
<p>Once you grasp that consciousness, you will feel your closeness
to the Creator of all things.
<p>Indeed, there is no other being on earth so nearly Godlike in
power as the mother who realizes what her influence over her unborn
child may be.
<p>The hard and painful path for you to walk is but a short one
compared to the long roadway to eternity for your child.
<p>Perhaps some great statesman, or some great artist, or some
great scientist or philosopher is lying under your heart, and it is
in your power to make or mar his development. Perhaps a Joan of
Arc, or a Rosa Bonheur, or a Martha Washington will crown you with
pride.
<p>Such genius and influence for good as the world has never before
known, from mortal sources, may be given to it through your unborn
child. How wonderful your privilege, how vast your power!
<p>Only a few short months, and then the growing wonder of a
child's unfolding mind, to beautify your days.
<p>Think of it in this way, dear little tired and nervous woman,
and God and all his angels will hover over you, I know, and all
will be well with you.
<p>My prayers are with you.

<a name="To_Mr_Alfred_Duncan"></a>
<h2>To Mr. Alfred Duncan</h2>
<p class="c3">Concerning the Ministry<br>
<p>And so you have changed your plan of life and, instead of
becoming an experimenter with the flesh, are going to be a healer
of souls.
<p>And what do I think about it? I am glad you are not to be an
M.D. There is an era coming when the doctor will be a prehistoric
creature. Oh, it is far, far away, but already the most progressive
minds have ceased to regard the family physician as an infallible
being.
<p>Medicine has made the least progress of any of the sciences in
the last few centuries.
<p>Credulity has cured more people than pills.
<p>Were you to study medicine, I should advise you to take up
surgery, osteopathy, electricity, the Kneippe Cure, milk diet, and
all the various methods of stimulating circulation; for the people
who patronize these treatments are increasing, as the powder and
pill patrons are on the decrease.
<p>Then, too, I should urge you to make a careful study of mental
and spiritual methods of cure, that you might be wholly equipped
for the dawn of the new age. You are a young man, and you will
probably live to see a wonderful change in the treatment of
disease, and to find the physician of the old school relegated to
the historian.
<p>But just as carefully you should now survey the religious
horizon, before beginning your studies for the ministry.
<p>It is utterly useless to stand with lifted eyes and say, "The
faith of my parents is good enough for me&mdash;good enough for all
mankind."
<p>Had the children of ancient Salem said that, and their children
repeated it, you would probably be lighting faggots at this moment
to roast a "witch," instead of a brother of the opposite creed.
<p>The narrow, intolerant old dogmas have been forced into
elasticity by the later generations, and the broadening work still
goes on.
<p>It makes no difference how satisfied you may be with a
prospective lake of fire for your enemies, the congregations you
are to address will not listen to that style of sermon as did your
grandparents.
<p>Only the ignorant minds to-day harbour ideas of cruelty and
revenge in connection with a Creator.
<p>Thinkers find such theories inconsistent with religious belief.
Individual thought is leading to individual faith.
<p>Where once I believed in a universal church for all the world, I
now believe in a separate creed for each soul, one fashioned to
suit his own particular need, with the underlying basis of love for
all created things as its foundation.
<p>Let each man worship in his own way, and follow his own ideal of
duty to God and humanity.
<p>If it is the pleasure of one to give up all his worldly goods,
and to go and live and labour among the poor, wish him Godspeed;
but if another keeps his place among men of affairs, makes money
honestly, and uses it unselfishly, let him, too, have your
blessing, since he is setting a good example for the
worldly-minded. If one man finds himself nearer to God on Sunday by
going out and peacefully enjoying the beauties of nature and the
association of his kind, do not try to convince him that he is on
the highway to perdition because he does not sit in a pew and
listen to depressing sermons.
<p>The day is over for that type of clergyman to succeed.
<p>Make a study of the needs of men <i>to-day</i>, and suit your
sermons to those needs.
<p>Men need to know more of the wonders of God's universe. Talk to
them in a brief, concise, interesting manner of the recent
discoveries of science, and their frequent remarkable corroboration
of the old religious theories. Thousands of years ago, in Egypt and
India, wise men said that metals and all created things possessed
life, and were a part of one great immortal whole, of which man was
the highest expression.
<p>Science is "discovering" and proving the truth of many
statements made by those old seers and savants. Call the attention
of the men of to-day to this fact, and set them thinking on the
wonders of the immortal soul.
<p>The man of to-day is an egotist regarding his scientific
achievements. He has grown to think of himself as a giant before
whose material success all other things must give way. He believes
that he has discovered, invented, photographed and made profitable
all the "facts" of the universe, and is inclined to regard with
intolerance any idea beyond his own mechanical domain.
<p>Tell him how much was divined thousands of years ago, and lead
him to realize the mighty depths of the unsounded ocean of his own
being.
<p>To know your own triple self, body, mind, and spirit, and to
make yourself a complete man, with the body beautiful, the mind
clear, the spirit radiant, is better than to have all the Bibles of
the ages, in all their ancient languages, at your tongue's tip.
<p>Help men to the building of character, which shall enable them
to be honest in street and mart, unselfish in home and society, and
sympathetic to their fellow pilgrims.
<p>Salvation is gained as a house is built, brick by brick, day
after day, not by spasmodic efforts one day in the week, and the
destruction of that effort in the remaining six.
<p>And each man must be his own mason, and select and lay his own
bricks. All the clergyman can do is to act the part of overseer.
<p>The man who goes to another, and expects his prayers to save
him, is like the mason who expects the "boss" to do his work, while
he draws the pay. Do no man's task&mdash;physical, mental, or spiritual.
That is not friendship or religion. Your work is to stimulate
others to do their own work, think their own thoughts, and live
their own lives.
<p>The world to-day demands facts to sustain faith.
<p><i>Spiritual facts are to be obtained</i>.
<p>Find them: for once convinced of the continuation of life beyond
the grave, and of the necessity to earn its privileges, by
self-conquest and character-building, humanity will rise "from the
lowly earth to the vaulted skies," and will realize that this earth
is but the anteroom to larger spheres of usefulness.
<p>Go forth and find&mdash;go forth and find, and do not be afraid to
strike out of beaten paths and avoid ruts. Cultivate spiritual
courage. It is what few clergymen possess, and it will give you
individuality at least.
<p>Preach the religion of happy harmonious homes. Make men and
women realize that heaven must begin here, in order to continue
farther on, and that the angelic qualities, of love, sympathy,
goodness, appreciation, must be rehearsed in the body, before they
can be successfully enacted in full-dress angel costume with wings.
<p>God will not care for the eternal praises sung about his throne
by a man who swears at his wife on earth, or a wife who nags her
husband and children. It is no use expecting a r&ocirc;le in a
continuous performance of happiness in heaven, if you do not learn
one line of the part on earth.
<p>Make your congregations think of the necessity to <i>live</i>
their religion in earth's commonplace daily situations.
<p>That is the religion the world needs.

<a name="To_Mr_Charles_Gray"></a>
<h2>To Mr. Charles Gray</h2>
<p class="c3">Concerning Polygamy<br>
<p>All that you say, regarding the excitement over the seating of
your Salt Lake Senator, is quite true.
<p>I have visited your city, and have made the acquaintance of many
of your people, and I know the private life of the gentleman you
sent to represent you in Washington is beyond reproach.
<p>He is a good husband, a good father, a good citizen. He was born
of a polygamous father and mother, and his childhood's home was a
happy one. He was educated in the belief that it was wrong for a
man to cohabit with any woman not his wife, but right for him to
marry many wives.
<p>He has not married many wives, however, and does not intend to.
His private life, his domestic life and his financial record are
all clean and clear of stain.
<p>So much cannot be said of many other Senators and
Representatives at our capitol.
<p>Good women are horrified when seeking government positions to
find how the sacrifice of virtue is demanded as payment for
influence.
<p>These statements cannot be evaded or denied. Let one who
questions them investigate the conditions existing in Washington in
the past and to-day.
<p>What a record it would be were every girl and woman who had been
led into the path of folly by married Senators and Representatives
to come forth and tell her story!
<p>There are clean, decent, high-minded men in both houses. There
are good citizens, good patriots, good men there.
<p>But so long as one married seducer and misleader of women
retains a seat in either house unmolested, so long as one man stays
who is unfaithful to his marriage vows, the opposers of the Senator
from Utah should base their objections on other than moral grounds.
<p>But despite the facts you bring to bear on your argument, that
polygamy leads to more morality in the homes of the land than our
present conditions illustrate, I must disagree with you.
<p>I am opposed to polygamy. Any social arrangement which licenses
men to possess several women, to give full rein to their desires,
is a block to the wheels of progress.
<p>Not until man learns the lesson of self-control, as woman has
learned it, will humanity reach its highest development.
<p>Not until man ceases to place himself on a par with the
unreasoning male animal, when he argues on the subject of the
sexual relations, will he become the master of circumstance he is
meant to be.
<p>One man and one woman living sexually true to each other is the
ideal domestic life. Better strive toward that ideal, and fail and
strive again, than to lower it and accept license and
self-indulgence as the standard, under some religious name.
<p>Polyandry and polygamy are both evidences of a crude and
half-evolved humanity.
<p>They belong to a society which has not learned the law of
self-control as a part of its religious creed and the march of
progress. The light of science makes havoc of all such primitive
conditions.
<p>You tell me that your father was the husband of three wives, and
that all lived under one roof in sisterly love, and that you never
heard an unkind word spoken in your home, and that all three wives
loved you as a son. You tell me your father held high ideals of
womankind, and that the existence of a fallen woman was impossible
in your community.
<p>Now I contend that any woman who accepts less than the full
loyalty of the man to whom she gives herself for life <i>has fallen
from woman's highest estate</i>. She lowers not only herself, but
the whole sex.
<p>To take a third of a man's love, and to share his physical and
mental and spiritual comradeship with two other wives, is far more
immoral, to my thinking, than to take the whole of a man without
legal authority.
<p>It drags down and belittles woman in the eyes of man. It is
useless to contend that such conditions lead to respect.
<p>There is too much of the big male I, and the little female you,
in the arrangement. There is too much of the old idea that God made
man, and accident made woman, for man's use. There is too much of
self-indulgence for the man, and repression for the woman,&mdash;a
condition which has blocked the highest development of the race for
centuries.
<p>Meanwhile, I think it a great pity that society does not hold
the expectant mother in the same reverence as in your community.
That is certainly a lesson we can learn from the Mormons. And that
explains why your children, born of polygamous mothers, are
stronger physically, and more universally endowed mentally, than
the average children in the world at large.
<p>Mothers were guarded and protected and revered, and children
were made welcome, and no such crime as darkens our own social
world&mdash;the crime of destroying embryo life&mdash;was known in your midst.
<p>It is a glorious heritage to give a child this parental love and
welcome. It lasts through eternity.
<p>But it does not seem to me that it is necessary to have polygamy
prevail in order to produce right conditions for the propagation of
offspring. In time the world will realize the importance of
teaching men and women how to become good parents.
<p>It will learn, too, the magnificent results to be obtained from
one moral code for both sexes, and this result could never be
obtained in a polygamous community.

<h2>To Walter Smeed</h2>
<p class="c3">Concerning Creeds and Marriage<br>
<p>Before you left us, I realized that you and my pretty secretary
were finding matters of mutual interest.
<p>Therefore, I am not surprised that you are thinking seriously of
her as a future companion.
<p>Rosalie is a charming, intelligent, warm-hearted, excellent
girl, and there is no reason why she would not make you a good
wife, save the one you mention&mdash;the difference in your creeds.
<p>You are a Roman Catholic, Rosalie is a devout Protestant.
<p>Were the cases reversed, and were you the Protestant and Rosalie
the Catholic, I should say the chances of happiness were greater
than as conditions now stand.
<p>As a rule, the most religious man is more liberal than the
religious woman. And when marriage between a Roman Catholic and a
Protestant is the question, there is need of greater liberality on
the part of the Protestant than on that of the Catholic.
<p>Why? Because with the Protestant there is no consideration to be
thought of outside of his or her own convictions and feelings.
<p>With the Catholic, the power of the Church and the law regarding
the rearing of the children in its faith walks beside the
contracting party, sits at the table, and sleeps on the marital
couch.
<p>There is no happiness for the husband or wife who has entered
into such a marriage, after the arrival of children, unless the
laws of the Church are obeyed.
<p>When the wife is a Catholic, the fact that she is a good woman
and true wife satisfies the Protestant husband, as a rule, and he
makes no objection to her carrying out the contract with her Church
regarding the education of the children.
<p>If they are as moral and good as their mother, he does not care
what faith occupies their hearts or in what way they worship God.
<p>But to the mother this is a matter of vital importance.
<p>Woman is by nature more devout than man.
<p>Woman is by nature more tyrannical than man.
<p>Take those two characteristics, and add to them the tendency of
many women to bigotry and intolerance, and it makes the matter of
creeds vital in marriage.
<p>Rosalie is broader-minded than many women, yet she is devoted to
the Congregational Church, and rarely misses attendance.
<p>It will be an easy matter for her to accept your faith for
yourself and to allow you to attend your own church, and she is, I
am sure, broad enough to go with you occasionally, if you request
it.
<p>But when she becomes a mother, and the children's minds are
unfolding, I doubt her willingness to have them brought up in any
faith save her own.
<p>To an unwedded girl in love, a child is a very indistinct
creature.
<p>To a mother, it is a very real being.
<p>I have seen men as deeply in love as you are, with women as
liberal-minded as Rosalie, become very unhappy after marriage
through the opposite ideas of the wife regarding the education of
children.
<p>You must remember how much more closely a mother's life is
entwined about her children, and how much more of their association
usually falls to her than to the father.
<p>This is especially true of daughters, and is true of sons up to
a certain age.
<p>You can understand, I am sure, how much more companionship a
mother would find in children who accepted her faith and attended
her church than in those whose spiritual paths led in another
direction.
<p>I know Rosalie realizes that a good life, not a certain creed,
leads to the goal she seeks, after this phase of existence closes,
and she does not ask you to change your faith. But while she would
also believe her children were on the road to that goal, she would
want them to walk through her path and by her side.
<p>It will be hard to relinquish the woman you love, to-day, for
the children who might not come to-morrow.
<p>Yet I can give you the counsel you asked on this matter only
from my personal observation of similar unions.
<p>I should advise you to try an absence of some duration, and to
forget Rosalie if you can, since you have not yet declared
yourself.
<p>Better a little temporary sorrow than a life of discord.
<p>As you grow older your religion will, in all probability, gain a
stronger ascendency over your nature, and the church to which you
belong is very tenacious in its hold upon its members.
<p>Rosalie is not of a yielding nature, and as I said before, she
is more devoted to her church than most young women of the day.
<p>The physical phases of your love blind you now. But these phases
are only a part of the tie which must bind husband and wife to make
love enduring through all of life's vicissitudes.
<p>There must be mental companionship, and to be a complete union
there must be sympathy in spiritual ideas.
<p>The very young do not realize this fact, but it is forced upon
the mature.
<p>Marital love is like a tree. It first roots in the soil of
earth, and then lifts its branches to the heavens. Unless it does
so lift its branches it is stunted and deformed, and is not a tree.
Unless it roots in earth it is not a tree, but an air-plant or a
cobweb.
<p>You want to be sure the tree you are thinking to make a shelter
for your whole life, will have far-reaching and uplifting branches,
and will not be merely an earth-bound twig.
<p>Since your church permits no second marriage save by the door of
death, do not make a mistake in your first.
<p>Take a year, at least, of absence and separation, and think the
matter over.

<h2>To Sybyl Marchmont</h2>
<p class="c3">Concerning Her Determination to Remain Single<br>
<p>It is with genuine regret that I learn of your determination to
send my nephew out of your life. Wilfred is a royal fellow, as that
term is employed by us. He is what a man of royal descent in
monarchies rarely proves to be,&mdash;self-reliant, enterprising,
industrious, clean, and with high ideals of woman.
<p>Eight years ago I declined a request of his for a loan, and told
him my reasons&mdash;that I believed loans were an injury to our friends
or relatives. My letter seemed to arouse all the strength latent in
his nature, and he has made a remarkable record for himself since
that time. I have known that he was deeply in love with you for the
last two years, and I had hoped you would listen to his plea. He
tells me that you imparted your history to him, and that you say it
is your intention to remain single, as you would not like to bring
children into the world to suffer from the stigma upon your name.
He has shown me your letter wherein you say, "I am not in fault for
having to blush for the sins of my parents; but I would be in fault
if my children had to blush for the blemish upon the name of their
grandparents. I do not feel I could meet their questioning eyes
when they asked me about my parents. I can better bear the loss of
the personal happiness of a home and a husband's love."
<p>Wilfred is just the man to protect you and to keep the world at
a distance, where it could not affect your life by its comments. He
regards your birth in the same light that I do, and would rather
transmit your lovely qualities of soul and mind to his descendants
than the traits of many proudly born girls who are ready to take
him at the first asking: for you must know how popular he is with
our sex.
<p>I can not believe you are insensible to his magnetic and lovable
qualities, but, as you say, you have been so saddened by the sudden
knowledge of your history that it has blunted your emotions in
other directions. I can only hope this will wear away and that you
will reconsider your resolve and consent to make Wilfred the happy
and proud man you could, by becoming his wife.
<p><i>Never forget that God created love and man created
marriage</i>.
<p>And to be born of a loveless union is a darker blight than to be
born in love without union.
<p>But what I want to talk about now, is your determination to live
a single life and to devote yourself to reclaiming weak and erring
women. You are young to enter this field of work, yet at
twenty-four you are older than many women of thirty-five, because
you have had the prematurely ripening rain of sorrow on your life.
I know you will go into the work you mention with the sympathy and
understanding which alone can make any reformatory work successful.
Yet you are going to encounter experiences which will shock and
pain you, in ways you do not imagine now.
<p>You are starting out with the idea of most sympathetic good
women, that all erring souls of their own sex fall through betrayed
trust, and broken promises, and misplaced love. Such cases you will
encounter, and they will most readily respond to your efforts for
their reformation. But many of those you seek to aid will have gone
on the road to folly through mercenary motives, and this will prove
a vast obstacle.
<p>When a woman sells to Mammon, under any stress of circumstance,
that which belongs to Cupid, there is something left out of her
nature and character which renders the efforts of the reformers
almost useless. You know all real, lasting reform must come from
within. The woman who has once decided that fine apparel, and
comfort, and leisure, are of more value to her than her virtue
usually reaches old age or disease before the reformer can even
gain her attention. You will find many such among your
prot&eacute;g&eacute;es, and you may as well leave them to work out
their own reformation, and turn your energies to those who long for
a better life.
<p>It is that longing which means real reformation. To paraphrase
an old couplet&mdash;<span class="c4">The soul reformed against its
will</span><br>
<span class="c4">Clings to the same old vices still.</span><br>
<p>I do not believe in a forced morality, save as a protection to a
community. I believe in it as a legal fence, but it possesses no
value as a religious motive. It helps to save society some
annoyance, but it does not materially improve the condition of
humanity. Such improvements must come from the desire of men and
women to reach higher standards. So, after you have planted a
little seed in the mind of the mercenary Magdalene which may in
time sprout and grow, pass on, and find those who have gone wrong
from other causes, and who are longing for a hand to lead them
right.
<p>And of all things do not expect a girl who has lived in the
glare of red lights, and listened to the blare of bands, and worn
the ofttimes becoming garb of folly, and stimulated her spirits
with intoxicants&mdash;do not expect her, I say, to suddenly be contented
with quiet and solitude, and drudgery, and cheap, unlovely
garments, and goodness. Give her something to entertain her and to
occupy her mind, give her something to live for and hope for and to
be pleased over, besides the mere fact of reformation. The opium
victim, you must remember, can not at once partake of wholesome
food and be well and happy in the thought that he has given up his
drug. Neither can the folly victim. The standards of happiness and
contentment which the moral woman has always found satisfactory,
she too often considers sufficient for the sister who has wandered
from the path. But they are standards which, once lost, must be
gained step by step, painfully and slowly. They are not reached by
a bound. As much as possible keep your reformed sister's mind from
dwelling on the past, or from talking of her mistakes and sins.
Blot them from her memory by new and interesting plans and
occupations. The way to live a new life is to live it.
<p>And our thoughts and conversation are important parts of living.
Instead of praying aloud to God to forgive her sins, show the God
spirit in yourself by forgiving and forgetting and helping her to
forget.
<p>And now a word about yourself.
<p>You are twenty-four, lovely, sympathetic, fond of children and
animals, wholesome and normal in your habits, without crankiness,
and popular with both sexes. While there are many wives and widows
possessed of these qualities, there seems to be some handicap to
the spinster in the race of life who undertakes to arrive at middle
age with all the womanly attributes. Almost invariably she drops
some of them by the wayside. She becomes overorderly and fussy&mdash;so
that association with her for any length of time is
insupportable&mdash;or careless and indifferent. Or she may grow
inordinately devoted to animal pets, and bitter and critical toward
children and married people.
<p>She may develop mannish traits, and dress and appear more like a
man than a feminine woman.
<p>She may ride a hobby, to the discomfort of all other equestrians
or pedestrians on the earth's highway. She may grow so
argumentative and positive that she is intolerant and intolerable.
And whichever of these peculiarities are hers, she is quite sure to
be wholly unconscious of it, while she is quick to see that of
another. Now watch yourself, my dear Sybyl, as you walk alone
toward middle life; do not allow yourself to grow queer or
impossible. It was God's intent that every plant should blossom and
bear fruit, and that every human being should mate and produce
offspring. The plant that fails in any of its functions is usually
blighted in some way, and the woman who fails of life's full
experiences seems to show some repellent peculiarity. But she need
not, once she sets a watch upon herself; she has a conscious soul
and mind, and can control such tendencies if she will.
<p>It is unnatural for a woman to live without the daily
companionship of man. The superior single woman must make tenfold
the effort of the inferior wife, to maintain her balance into
maturity, because of her enforced solitude. As the wife-mother
grows older she is kept in touch with youth, and with the world,
while the opportunities for close companionship with the young
lessen as a single woman passes forty, unless she makes herself
especially adaptable, agreeable, and sympathetic.
<p>And this is what I want you to do. At twenty-four it is none too
soon to begin planning for a charming maturity.
<p>If you are determined upon a life of celibacy, determine also to
be the most wholesome, and normal, and all around liberal, womanly
spinster the world has ever seen.
<p>Peace and happiness to you in your chosen lot.

<h2>To Mrs. Charles Gordon</h2>
<p class="c3">Concerning Her Sister and Her Children<br>
<p>No, my dear Edna, I do not think it strange that you should seek
advice on this subject from a woman who has no living children.
<p>It seems to me no one is fitted to give such unbiased counsel
regarding the training of children as the woman of observation,
sympathy, and feeling, who has none of her own.
<p>Had I offspring, I would be influenced by my own successes, and
prejudiced by my own failures, and unable to put myself in your
place, as I now do.
<p>A mother rarely observes other people's children, save to
compare them unfavourably with her own. I regret to say that
motherhood with the average woman seems to be a narrowing
experience, and renders her less capable of taking a large,
unselfish view of humanity.
<p>The soldier in the thick of battle is able to tell only of what
he personally experienced and saw, just in the spot where he was
engaged in action.
<p>The general who sits outside the fray and watches the contest
can form a much clearer idea of where the mistakes occurred, and
where the greatest skill was displayed.
<p>I am that general, my dear friend, standing outside the field of
motherhood, and viewing the efforts of my battling sisters to rear
desirable men and women. And I am glad you have appealed to me
while your two children are yet babies to give you counsel, for I
can tell you where thousands have failed.
<p>And I thank you and your husband for reposing so much confidence
in my ideas.
<p>I think, perhaps, we had better speak of the postscript of your
letter first. You ask my opinion regarding the chaperon for your
sixteen-year-old sister, who is going abroad to study for a period
of years. Mrs. Walton will take her and keep her in her home in
Paris, and Miss Brown also stands ready to make her one of three
young girls she desires to chaperon and guide through a foreign
course of study in France and Germany.
<p>You like the idea of having your sister in a home without the
association of other American girls, until she perfects herself in
French, but you are worried about Mrs. Walton's being a divorced
woman. Miss Brown, the spotless spinster, seems the safer guide to
your friends, you tell me.
<p>I know the majority of women would feel that a single woman of
good standing and ungossiped reputation was a safe and desirable
protector for a young girl.
<p>The same majority would hesitate to send their girls away with a
divorced woman.
<p>But as I remarked in the beginning, I have stood outside the
fray and watched similar ventures, and I have grown to realize that
it is not mere respectability and chastity in a woman which make
her a safe chaperon for a young girl,&mdash;it is a deep, full, broad
understanding of temperaments and temptations.
<p>Had I a daughter or a sister like your sweet Millie, I would not
allow her to live one year under the dominion of such a woman as
Miss Brown for any consideration. Why? because Miss Brown is all
brain and bigotry. She is narrow and high, not deep and broad.
<p>She is so orthodox that she incites heresy in the rebellious
mind of independent youth. She is so moral she makes one long for
adventure. She would not listen to any questioning of old
traditions, or any speculative philosophizing of a curious young
mind, and she would be intolerant with any girl who showed an
inclination to flirt or be indiscreet.
<p>Your sister Millie is as coquettish as the rose that lifts its
fair face to the sun, and the breeze, and the bee, and expects to
be admired. She is as innocent as the rose, too, but that fact Miss
Brown would never associate with coquetry.
<p>She would class it with vulgarity and degeneracy. Miss Brown is
a handsome woman, but she has no sex instincts. She does not
believe with the scientist, "that in the process of evolution it is
only with the coming of the sex relation that life is enabled to
rise to higher forms."
<p>She believes in brain and spirit, and is utterly devoid of that
feminine impulse to make herself attractive to men, and wholly
incapable of understanding the fascination that Folly holds out to
youth. She has never experienced any temptation, and she would be
shocked at any girl who fell below her standard.
<p>She would carefully protect Millie from danger by high walls,
but she would never eradicate the danger impulse from her nature by
sympathetic counsel, as a more human woman could.
<p>Mrs. Walton is a much better guide for your sister.
<p>She ran away from boarding-school at seventeen, and married the
reckless son of a rich man. She had a stepmother of the traditional
type, and had never known a happy home life. She was of a loving
and trusting and at the same time a coquettish nature, and she
attracted young Walton's eye while out for a walk with a "Miss
Brown" order of duenna. The duenna saw the little embryo
flirtation, and became very much horrified, and preached the girl a
long sermon, and set a close watch upon her actions.
<p>There was no wise, loving guidance of a young girl's life barque
from the reefs of adventure. It was homily and force. The result
was, that the girl escaped from school before six weeks passed, and
married her admirer.
<p>He was fifteen years her senior, a reckless man of the world,
even older in experience than in years. He proved a very bad
husband, but his young wife remained with him until his own father
urged her to leave him. She was quietly divorced, and has lived
abroad almost ever since, and holds an excellent position in the
French capital, as well as in other European centres, and she is
most exemplary in her life. Mr. Walton is now an inmate of a
sanitarium, a victim of paresis.
<p>I can imagine no one so well fitted to exert the wisest
influence upon Millie's life as Mrs. Walton.
<p>There is a woman who has run the whole gamut of girlish folly,
and who knows all the phases of temptation. She knows what it is to
possess physical attractions, and to be flattered by the admiration
of men, and she has passed through the dark waters of disillusion
and sorrow. She would be the one to help Millie out of dangerous
places by sympathy and understanding, instead of using sermons and
keys.
<p>She would mould her young, wax-like character by the warmth of
love, instead of freezing it by austere axioms.
<p>Miss Brown would make an indiscreet young girl feel hopelessly
vulgar and immodest; Mrs. Walton that she understood all about her
foolish pranks, and was able to lead her in the better paths.
<p>Miss Brown prides herself upon never having lost her head with
any man.
<p>Mrs. Walton is like some other women I have known, who have made
mistakes of judgment. She lost her head, but in the losing and the
sorrow that ensued she found a heart for all humanity.
<p>There are women in this world whose cold-white chastity freezes
the poor wayfarer who tries to find in their vicinity rest and
comfort and courage.
<p>Other women cast a cooling shadow, in which the sun-scorched
pilgrim finds peace&mdash;the shadow of a past error, from which spring
fragrant ferns and sweet grasses, where tired and bleeding feet may
softly tread.
<p>Mrs. Walton's life casts the shadow of divorce on her pathway,
but it is only the warm, restful shadow of a ripening and mellowing
sorrow. Do not fear to have Millie walk in it.
<p>It will be better for her than the steady glare from a glacier.
<p>I find I have said so much about your sister that I must reserve
my counsel about your children for another letter.
<p>Your postscript was brief, but pregnant with suggestion, and
called for this long reply.
<p>I shall write you again in a few days.

<h2>To Mrs. Charles Gordon</h2>
<p class="c3">Concerning Her Children<br>
<p>Your wish to have your son, who is now four years old, begin to
develop the manly qualities, and your oldest daughter, who has
reached the mature age of three, start wisely on the path to lovely
womanhood, is far from being premature.
<p>"The tree inclines as the twig is bent," we are told.
<p>Most mothers wait until the tree is in blossom before they begin
to train its inclination.
<p>Your boy is quite old enough to be taught manly pride, in being
useful to you and his sisters.
<p>Such things are not successfully taught by preaching or scolding
or punishing; but are more easily inculcated by tact and praise,
object-lesson and play.
<p>A four-year-old boy is all ears when his father's praises and
achievements are recounted. Any father, save a brute, is a hero in
the eyes of his four-year-old son. I am sure Mr. Gordon has many
admirable traits you can use as interesting topics.
<p>Tell little Charlie how proud you are to have a son who will be
like his father, and attend to the needs of and look after the
interests of his mother and sisters.
<p>Make him think that to be of service to you or his sisters is
one of the first steps toward manhood, as indeed it is.
<p>When he performs any small kindness, praise his manliness.
<p>Teach him to open doors, and to make way for women and elders,
as a part of manly courtesy.
<p>Speak with gentle disapproval of the unfortunately common type
of American boy who pushes women and older people aside to scramble
into public conveyances and secure a seat before them.
<p>Say how proud you are that your son could not be guilty of such
unmanly conduct.
<p>When you are walking with him, call his attention to any woman
or child or poor man in trouble, and if his services can be of use,
urge him to offer them.
<p>I saw one day a small boy spring to the aid of an old coloured
woman who had dropped a lot of parcels in the street, and I thought
it was a certain evidence that his mother was a rare and sweet
woman. For the manners of little boys are almost invariably what
their mothers make them.
<p>Awake early in his heart a sympathy for the deformed, the
crippled, and otherwise unfortunate beings.
<p>There is no other country where such vulgar and heartless
curiosity, and even ridicule, is bestowed upon grotesque or
unsightly types of humanity, as in America.
<p>A little dwarfed girl in New York City committed suicide a few
years ago because she was so weary of being laughed at and
ridiculed by her associates in the street and at school.
<p>Think of that, in this Christian age, and in the metropolis of
America!
<p>An old street peddler was set upon by school-children and so
annoyed and misused that he became insane.
<p>Another was injured by street children&mdash;the children of the
public schools&mdash;and died from the effects of their abuse.
<p>This is the fault of mothers who have never deemed it their duty
and privilege to awaken the tender and protective qualities in the
character of their children.
<p>Speak often to your boy of the pathos of dumb animals dependent
upon human thoughtfulness for food, drink, and decent usage.
<p>Say what a privilege it seems to you to be able to befriend
them, and to be a voice for them in making others realize their
duty to our dumb brothers.
<p>Obtain interesting books on natural history and read stories of
animal life to your boy. Instruct him in the habits of beast, bird,
and insect, and talk to him of the wonderful domestic instincts and
affections in many of our speechless associates. The exhilaration
of the wild bird, and the happiness of the deer and the hare in the
woods and fields, call to his mind day by day. It will be more
gratifying to you when he is man grown to feel he is the loving
friend and protector, rather than the skilled hunter of bird and
beast.
<p>The higher order of man does not seek slaughter for amusement.
He realizes that he has no right to take, save for self-protection,
that which he cannot give.
<p>Make your son a higher order of man by developing those brain
cells and leaving the destructive and cruel portions of the brain
to shrink from lack of use.
<p>Even in his play with his inanimate toys, you can be arousing
the best or the worst part of your boy's nature.
<p>The child who whips and screams at his hobby-horse usually, when
a man, whips and bellows at his flesh and blood steed.
<p>Tell him the play-horse is more easily managed by coaxing and
petting, and that loud voices make it nervous and frightened.
<p>Suggest water and feed at suitable times, and express sorrow for
the horses with no kind boys to look out for them.
<p>Start a humane society in the nursery and make your boy
president and your little girl honorary member, and act as
treasurer and secretary yourself.
<p>Give him a medal when he offers food to a hungry street animal
or speaks to a driver cruel to his horse, or performs any other
kind act. This will be interesting play to your children, and it
will be sowing seed in fallow ground.
<p>Your baby girl is already old enough to take pride in picking up
the toys she scatters, and putting her chair where it belongs. Make
it a part of your hour of sport with her to help her do these
things. She will not know she is being taught order.
<p>I learned this lesson from a famous author whose baby son was
anxious to play about the library where his father was at work.
<p>The first act of the toddler was to toss all the books in sight
upon the floor and to sit down and turn the leaves, hunting for
pictures. This performance interested him for half an hour, when he
proceeded to seek new fields of action.
<p>"But now let us have great fun putting all the books back just
where we found them," cried the tactful father, with a wink and a
laugh, which made the child believe he was to enjoy the sport of
his life. And it <i>was</i> made sport by the foolish pranks of the
father who knew how little it took to interest a child.
<p>The next day, and the next, the same fall and rise in the book
market took place, but on the fourth day the father was too deeply
engrossed in work to assist in the replacing of the books: when,
lo! the small lad, after a wistful waiting and unanswered call,
proceeded to put the books all back alone.
<p><i>The first important brick in the foundation wall of order was
laid</i>.
<p>So you can teach your little girl all the womanly habits of
method, and order, and neatness, and system, if you have the
patience to act the part of playmate with her a few moments daily.
<p>As she grows in understanding and years, keep yourself at her
side, her nearest friend. Let her feel that she can express her
every thought to you, and that every question which presents itself
to her developing mind, you will seek to answer to the best of your
ability.
<p>Be her confidant, her adviser, her friend, and let her find
pride and happiness in doing things for you.
<p>Never act as maid or domestic to your daughter.
<p>Be the queen and make her your first lady-in-waiting, and show
her the courtesy and appreciation her position demands from
royalty. She will be a better daughter, and a better wife and
mother, later in life, if you do not make the mistake of the
average American mother of waiting upon her from the cradle to the
altar. Let her grow up with the quiet understanding that you are to
be first considered, in matters social and financial. Your wardrobe
must be as well looked after as her own, and if there is to be
economy for one, let her practise it.
<p>The daughter who has a whole household sacrificing and toiling
for her pleasures is spoiled for a wife and woman. The most
admirable young women I have known&mdash;and I have known many&mdash;are those
who were taught to take it as a matter of course that the mother
was first to be considered, and lovingly served.
<p>Do not be afraid of making your daughter vain by telling her the
attractive features she may possess.
<p>Some one else will if you do not, and it is well for her to hear
it from lips which may more successfully offer counsel afterward. A
certain confidence in her own charms gives a sensibly reared young
woman a poise and self-possession which is to be desired. A touch
of feminine vanity renders a woman more anxious to please, and more
alert to keep always at her best.
<p>But beware of having her acquire egotism. Silly conceit is the
death-blow to higher attainments and to all charm.
<p>Teach your daughter early the accomplishment of listening well.
She will be certain to please if she understands its value.
<p>A woman who looks the converser in the eyes, and does not allow
her glance to wander and become distrait, and who does not
interrupt before the recital is finished, can be sure of popularity
with both men and women.
<p>Give both your son and daughter confidence in themselves and
belief in their power to achieve. There is tremendous power in the
early inoculation by the home influence of self-confidence, when it
is tempered by modesty and consideration for others.
<p>Remember whatever in your own bringing up seems to-day
unfortunate, and avoid it in the training of your children.
<p>Remember whatever was good and helpful, and emulate it.

<h2>To Miss Zoe Clayborn Artist</h2>
<p class="c3">Concerning the Attentions of Married Men<br>
<p>I am sure, my dear niece, that you are a good and pure-minded

than the one you mention.
<p>For it was a mistake when you accepted Mr. Gordon's telephone
message to lunch alone with him at a restaurant, even though you
knew his wife might not object.
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Gordon are happily married, parents of several
children. They are broader and more liberal and more unselfish than
most parents, and they went out of their path to extend courtesies
to you, a young country girl&mdash;at first because you were my niece,
then because they liked you personally.
<p>When I first wrote Mrs. Gordon that you were to open a studio in
Chicago after your course of study in the East, she expressed deep
interest in you, and seemed anxious to have you consider her as a
friend&mdash;always ready to act as a chaperon or adviser when you felt
the need of wiser guidance than your own impulses.
<p>Mrs. Gordon knew that your experience of the world was limited
to a country village in the West, and two years' study at the Pratt
Institute. While there she knew you boarded with a cousin of your
mother's, and enjoyed the association and privileges of the
daughters of the home.
<p>To start alone in Chicago, and live in your studio, and dine
from a chafing-dish, and sleep in an unfolded combination bureau
and refrigerator&mdash;has more fascinations to your mind than to Mrs.
Gordon's. She was reared in comfort, bordering on luxury, and while
her early home life was not happy, she enjoyed all the refinements
and all the privileges of protected girlhood.
<p>She knows city life as you cannot know it, and, although she
discards many of the burden&mdash;some conventions of society, she
realizes the necessity of observing some of its laws.
<p>She wanted you to feel that you had the background of a
wholesome home, and the protection of clean, well-behaved married
friends in your exposed situation; her attitude to you is just what
she would want another woman to hold toward her daughter, were she
grown up and alone in a large city.
<p>You have been her guest, and she has been your good friend. Mr.
Gordon admired you from the first, and that was a new incentive for
this most tactful and liberal of wives to befriend you. She always
cultivates the women he likes.
<p>This is excellent policy on the part of a wife. If the husband
has any really noble qualities or possesses a sterling character,
he will appreciate and respect his wife's confidence, and never
violate it; and added to this, he will usually become disillusioned
with the women he has admired from a distance, when he sees them
frequently at too close range.
<p>A wife can make no greater mistake than trying to fence her
husband about and obtruding high walls between him and the women he
admires. Far better bring them near and turn on the calcium light.
<p>Mr. Gordon is a born lover of the fair sex, a born gallant. He
is, at the same time, a clean, self-respecting man. But he has
grown a trifle selfish and a bit vain of late years.
<p>He does not fully realize what the interesting family of
children he shows with such pride to his friends has meant to their
mother.
<p>It has not occurred to him that to be the mother of three
children, the youngest one year old, after six years of married
life, has required a greater outlay of all the mental, moral, and
physical forces than has been demanded of their father.
<p>He is a good husband,&mdash;yet he is not the absolutely unselfish and
liberal and thoughtful husband that Mrs. Gordon is wife.
<p>If she seemed to you at all nervous, or less adaptable to your
moods than he, you should stop and consider the many causes which
might have led to this condition.
<p>You are young, handsome, gifted, and unconventional, and all
these things appeal to men. You can attract all the admirers you
want, and more than you need, to enlarge your ideas of life, and
extend your knowledge of human nature.
<p>You say your ambition is to know the world thoroughly,&mdash;that it
will aid your art.
<p>I think that is true, if you do not pass the border-line and
lose your ideals and sacrifice your principles. Once you do that,
your art will lose what it can never regain.
<p>And remember this, my dear girl, no human being ever lived or
ever will live who gained anything worth having <i>by sacrificing
the golden rule.</i> In your search for knowledge of the world, and
acquaintance with human nature, <i>keep that motto ever before your
soul's sight,</i> "Do unto others as you would have them do unto
you."
<p>You say Mr. Gordon said or did nothing in that
t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te luncheon his wife might not have
heard or seen, but the fact that he talked entirely about you and
art, and other universal subjects, and seemingly avoided any
reference to his wife and children, surprised you.
<p>And now you are wondering if you did wrong to accept this
invitation. Never accept invitations of any kind from married men,
unless the wife or some member of the family is included.
<p>No matter how willing the wife may be to have you enjoy her
husband's company, avoid t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te situations
with benedicts.
<p>You say you are not egotistical enough to imagine Mr. Gordon had
any hidden motive for wanting to be alone with you, or for
seemingly forgetting in his conversation that he was a husband and
father. Yet I can see that in a measure it disillusioned you.
<p>You do not ask a man to fling his wife and children at the head
of each woman he meets, but you like him to recognize their
existence.
<p>You are a young, romantic girl seeking the ideal.
<p>You want to find happy wives and husbands,&mdash;men and women who
have sailed away from the Strands of Imagination to the more
beautiful land of the Real, from whose shores they beckon you,
saying: "Here is happiness and great joy. Come and join us, and
feel no fear in flinging the illusions of youth behind you."
<p>If married men only knew that is what young women are
seeking,&mdash;if married women only knew that is what young men are
seeking, what reconstruction would take place in the deportment of
husbands and wives!
<p>Never yet did a married woman indulge in flirtatious or
sentimental converse with a bachelor without lowering herself and
all women in his heart of hearts.
<p>Never yet did a married man seem to forget his domestic ties in
the presence of single women without losing a portion of their
respect, however they may have been flattered by his attentions.
<p>In every man's heart, in every woman's, is this longing to find
husbands and wives who are satisfied and happy and proud, above all
other things, of their loyalty.
<p>It would be well for you to keep this fact before the minds of
the men you meet. You can, in a small way, do your little toward
educating on this subject the married men you encounter. And you
can save yourself some embarrassing experiences.
<p>It is no compliment to you if the husband of your friend, or a
stranger, falls in love with you.
<p>It is an easy matter for a young, attractive woman to infatuate
irresponsible men.
<p>It is a far greater compliment to you when women respect and
trust you, and when you help elevate the ideals of weak men
regarding your sex.
<p>You can study the whole Encyclopedia of Manhood without breaking
through the glass doors of your friend's bookcases. And you can
live a free, unconventional life without sacrificing one principle,
though you may ignore some customs. It is not the custom in
conventional society for young women to go to theatres or dinners
alone with young men. Yet I am perfectly willing you should join
the large army of self-supporting, self-respecting, and well
educated girls who do these things. You have been reared with that
American idea of independence, and with that confidence in your
ability to protect your virtue and good name, which carries the
vast majority of our young women safely through all the
vicissitudes of youth, and sends them chaste wives to the altar.
Our American men understand this attitude of our girls, and half of
them respect it, without being forced to, as the other half can be,
if woman so wills.
<p>There is no reason, to my thinking, why you should not enjoy the
companionship of interesting bachelors and widowers, and take the
courtesies they offer, with no chaperon but your own pride, taste,
and will. So long as you know, and these men know, that you are
doing nothing and going nowhere you need remember with shame or
regret, the next day, just so long you are on no dangerous path.
<p>But you must draw the line at married men, happy or unhappy. Any
confidential, t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te companionship of a
single woman with a married man cheapens her in the eyes of all
other men and women.
<p>It is a simpler matter to drift into free and easy manners and
call them "bohemian" than to cleanse your reputation of their
stain, or lift your mind from the mire to which they inevitably
lead.
<p>Once a woman begins to excuse her lawless conduct on the ground
of her "artistic temperament," there are no depths to which she may
not sink.
<p>Take pride in being at once independent yet discreet; artistic,
yet sensible; a student of men, yet an example of high-minded
womanhood; an open foe to needless conventions, yet a staunch
friend of principles; daring in methods, yet irreproachable in
conduct; and however adored by men, worthy of trust by all women.
<p>Do not take the admiration of men too seriously. Waste no
vitality in a rage over their weaknesses and vices. Regard them
with patience and inspire them to strive for a better goal than
self-indulgence.
<p>You can safely take it for granted that many who approach you
with compliments for your charms, and pleas for your favours, would
make the same advances to any other attractive girl they chanced to
encounter.
<p>Too many young women mistake a habit for a grand passion. And
they forget, while they are studying man, that he is studying
woman, and testing her susceptibility to flattery and her readiness
to believe in his simulated infatuation.
<p>Do not fall into the error of so many young country girls in a
large city, and imagine you can establish new laws, create a new
order of things, and teach men new lessons.
<p>A great city is like an ever-burning fire,&mdash;the newcomers who
thrust in their fingers will be scorched and scarred, but the fire
will not be changed or extinguished.
<p><i>Keep out of the fire</i>.
<p>There is no reason why you should scar yourself or smoke your
garments while keeping comfortably warm.

<h2>To Mr. Charles Gordon</h2>
<p class="c3">Concerning the Jealousy of His Wife After Seven Years
of Married Life<br>
<p>I have read your letter with care. I can readily understand that
you would not appeal to your wife's mother in this matter upon
which you write me, as she has been the typical mother-in-law,&mdash;the
woman who never gets along well with her children, and who never
wants others to succeed where she fails. I recollect your telling
me how she marred the wedding ceremony, by weeping and fainting,
after having nagged her poor daughter during twenty years of life,
and interfered with her friendships, through that peculiar jealousy
which she misnamed "devoted love."
<p>And now you are afraid that your wife is developing the same
propensity, and you ask me to use my influence to cure her of it in
its incipiency. You think I stand closer to Edna than any other
friend.
<p>"It is only during the last two or three years that Edna has
shown this tendency," you say. "Until then she seemed to me the
most sensible and liberal-minded of women, always admiring the
people I liked, and even going out of her way to be courteous and
cordial to a woman I praised. Of late she has seemed so different,
and has often been sarcastic, or sulky, or hysterical, when I
showed the common gallantries of a man fond of the society of
ladies."
<p>You think it is her inherited tendency cropping out, and that
she is unconscious of it herself.
<p>Well now permit me, my dear Mr. Gordon, to be very frank with
you.
<p>I met your wife only once before she married you.
<p>She was a merry-hearted, healthy girl, with superb colour, and
the figure of a young Venus. She was a belle, and much admired by
many worth-while men.
<p>During her honeymoon, she wrote me a most charming letter
speaking of her happiness, and of her desire to make you an ideal
wife.
<p>You and Edna were my guests for a few days when your first child
was a year old. She seemed more beautiful than ever, with an added
spiritual charm, and you were the soul of devotion.
<p>You are the type of man who pays a compliment as naturally as he
breathes, and whose vision is a sensitive plate which retains an
impression of every feminine grace. This impression is developed in
the memory-room afterward, and framed in your conversation.
<p>The ordinary mind calls such a man a flirt, or, in common
parlance, "a jollier;" but I know you to be merely appreciative of
womankind in general, while your heart is beautifully loyal to its
ideal. You are a clean, wholesome man, who could not descend to
intrigue. You are fine-looking, and you possess a gift in
conversing.
<p>Of course women are attracted to you. Edna was proud of this
fact, and seemed to genuinely enjoy your popularity.
<p>That was five years ago.
<p>One year ago I visited your home. Edna was the mother of three
children, born during the first five years of marriage.
<p>She had sacrificed her bloom to her babies, and was pallid and
anaemic. Her form had lost its exquisites curves, and she seemed
years older than her age-older indeed than you, although she is
four years your junior. It is a mere incident to be a father of
three children. It is a lifetime experience to be their mother. She
had developed nerves, and tears came as readily as laughter came of
old.
<p>She was devoted to her children, and felt a deep earnestness
regarding her responsibility as a mother. But she was still the
intensely loving wife, while you had sunk your r&ocirc;le of
lover-husband in that of adoring father.
<p>You did not seem to think of Edna's delicate state of health, or
notice her fading beauty. You regarded her as a faithful nurse for
your children, and whenever you spoke of her it was as the mother,
not as the sweetheart and wife.
<p>When I mentioned the drain upon a woman's vitality to bring
three robust children into life in five years, you said it was only
a "natural function," and referred to the old-time families of ten
and twelve children. Your grandmother had fourteen, you said, and
was the picture of health at seventy-five.
<p>My own grandmother gave ten children to the world. But we must
recollect how different was the environment in those days.
<p>Our grandmothers lived in the country, and knew none of the
strain and excitement of these modern times. The high pressure of
social and financial conditions, as we know them, the effort to
live up to the modern standards, the congested city life and the
expensive country life, all these things make motherhood a
different ordeal for our women than our grandmothers. Where our
grandfathers took their share of the care and guidance of children,
and the children came up in a wholesome country fashion, our men
to-day are so driven by the money gadfly that they can only whirl
around and around and attend "to business," and all the care of the
children falls upon the mother, or else upon the nurses and
governesses, who in turn are a care and a worry to the wife.
<p>You assured me Edna had all the assistants in caring for her
children she wanted, but you did not realize that every paid
employ&eacute; in a household is, as a rule, just so much more care
to the mistress, not less than a tax on the husband's purse and,
consequently, on his time.
<p>What Edna craves is <i>your</i> love, <i>your</i> attention,
<i>your</i> sympathy, not the service of paid domestics. She wants
you to notice her fading bloom, and to take her in your arms and
say, tenderly, "Little girl, we must get those old roses back. And
we must go away for a new honeymoon, all alone, and forget every
care, even if we forget the babies for a few days."
<p>One little speech like that, one little outing like that, would
do more toward driving away the demon of jealousy than all I could
by a thousand sermons and homilies.
<p>I remember at your own board you made me uncomfortable talking
about my complexion, which you chose to say was "remarkable for a
woman of my age." And then you proceeded to describe some wonderful
beauty you had seen at the Country Club the day previous, and all
the time I saw the tears hidden back under the lids of Edna's tired
eyes, and a hurt look on her pale face. Do you imagine she was
<i>jealous</i> of your compliment to me? or of your praise of the
girl's beauty at the Country Club?
<p>No, no, my dear Mr. Gordon, I know Edna too well to accuse her
of such petty feelings. She was only hurt at your lack of taste in
accenting her own lost bloom by needlessly emphasizing another's
possession of what had once been hers.
<p>Yet she called upon the young lady that very day and invited her
to luncheon, and even then you indulged in pronounced admiration of
the guest's cheeks, gallantly requesting your wife to have the
bouquet of carnation pinks removed from the table, as they were so
shamed by the complexions of the ladies.
<p>Of course it was gracefully worded in the plural, but your
pallid wife could not claim her share of it, and you should have
realized the fact. And the reason she could not was that she had
sacrificed her health in your service, in giving your children to
you, and in losing her lover.
<p>She adores her splendid babies, but she is still a woman and a
wife,&mdash;though you seem to ignore that she is anything but a mother.
<p>Right about face, Mr. Gordon, and become the lover you were, and
jealousy will be driven from your threshold.
<p>It is your own lack of thoughtfulness, your own tactless and
tasteless methods with your wife, which have caused the change in
her manner. She is not jealous, she is only lonely, heart-hungry,
disillusioned.
<p>You are less noble, less considerate, less tender, less
sympathetic than she believed. For the man to whom these adjectives
can be applied will guard, love, and cherish the wife of his youth,
and the mother of his children, before all other considerations;
and he will understand how sensitive a fading wife may be, and not
confound that sensitiveness with ignoble jealousy.
<p>It is you, Charles Gordon, who must cure your wife of nerves,
hysteria, and incipient jealousy, not I.
<hr class="c2">
<a name="To_Mrs_Clarence_St_Claire"></a>
<h2>To Mrs. Clarence St. Claire</h2>
<p class="c3">Concerning Her Husband<br>
<p>I am sorry that your matrimonial barque meets so many rough
winds while hardly out of Honeymoon Bay.
<p>Clarence and you seemed so deeply in love when I last saw you,
six months after your wedding, that I had hoped all might go well
with you.
<p>I knew the disposition of Clarence to be tainted with jealousy,
but hoped you would be able to eradicate it from his nature.
<p>You know his poor mother suffered agonies from the infidelities
of his father before Clarence was born. She had married a handsome
foreigner with whom she was desperately enamoured, while he cared
only for the fortune she brought him.
<p>While still in the full light of the honeymoon he began to
indulge in flirtations and amours, and poor Clarence, during the
important prenatal period of life, received the mark of suspicion
and the tendency to hypersensitiveness which then dominated the
mother.
<p>By the time Elise was born she had passed through the whole
process, and was passive and indifferent.
<p>I cannot help a sensation of amusement, even in face of the
condition you describe (which is little short of tragic), as I
recall the letter Clarence wrote begging me to try and prevent, by
fair means or foul, his sister's marriage to old Mr. Volney.
<p>That was two years before you and Clarence were married.
<p>Elise, we all know, wedded for the money and position Mr. Volney
gave, in return for her young beauty.
<p>Clarence and you were ideal lovers, seeing nothing in the world
outside of your own selves.
<p>Yet Elise is quite contented, and Mr. Volney uses what little
brain he has left to exult over his possession of such a beautiful
young wife.
<p>Elise upholds his dignity and flatters him into a belief that he
is a great philanthropist and a social power, and in this way she
has the handling of his millions, which is her idea of happiness.
She travels, entertains, and poses for photographs and paintings in
imported gowns, and there is no rumour of discontent or divorce.
<p>Meanwhile, Clarence, who was so opposed to her marriage because
it was loveless, is making a mess of his own love-match, through
his jealousy.
<p>You, who knew him to be insanely jealous as a lover, and who
seemed to be flattered with what you thought a proof of his
devotion, appeal to me now to know what to do with the husband who
is destroying your love and your happiness! Surely, if Elise knew
of this she might well say, "He laughs best who laughs last."
<p>I know that you were absorbed in Clarence for the first year of
your married life, and that you gave no least cause for any
jealousy, and I know, as you say, that even then he was often
morbid and unhappy over nothing at all.
<p>He was jealous even of girl friends and relatives, and if you
attended a matin&eacute;e with one of them, he sulked the whole
evening.
<p>This was little more than he did as a lover, and you should have
begun in those days to reason him out of such moods.
<p>You imagined then it was his mad love for you which caused his
unreasonable jealousy.
<p>But jealousy is self-love, and selfishness lies at the root of
such conditions of mind as his.
<p>A woman should say to a man who sulks or goes into tantrums when
she pays courteous attentions to relatives or acquaintances, "You
are lowering my ideal of you&mdash;I cannot love a man who will indulge
such unworthy moods. You insult my womanhood and doubt my
principles by your suspicions; you intimate that I have neither
truth, or judgment, or pride. You must conquer yourself, and learn
to trust me and to believe in me, or I must decide I am no woman
for you to take as a life companion." A man should take the same
course toward a jealous sweetheart or wife.
<p>A few quiet but firm assertions of this nature, when you were
being wooed, would have given Clarence an idea that he could lose
you, and that he was making himself ridiculous in your eyes.
Instead, you boasted to your friends how wildly infatuated he was,
and Clarence took new pride in his own blemish of character.
<p>Now that you have to live day, and night, and week, and month,
and year, with this trait, it seems a less romantic phase of
devotion, I fancy. But you are not wise to grow reckless and ignore
the wishes of your husband in all ways, because he is unreasonable.
"Since he is so absolutely impossible to please," you say, "I may
as well please myself. I have decided to take some of the liberties
so many of my acquaintances do, and enjoy life outside my home if I
cannot enjoy it within."
<p>Then you proceed to tell me how more than half your associates
drive, lunch, and dine with men acquaintances, and how
old-fashioned they consider your scruples. And you tell me that,
despite your rectitude, Clarence insults you almost daily by his
unreasoning jealousy of men, women, and even children.
<p>"I have about made up my mind to be less prudish and enjoy
myself, as I am sure Clarence cannot be any more jealous than he
is," you say.
<p>Now since you have asked my advice in the matter, I can only
urge you to reconsider this last determination.
<p>So long as you are, according to law and in the eyes of the
world, the wife of a man, you cannot escape comment if you are
frequently seen in public places alone with another.
<p>Were you to look into the hearts of other men who ask you to
dine, drive, or lunch alone with them, you would find a feeling of
increased respect when you decline, although they may show only
disappointment on the surface. I know that many wives of
unblemished reputation accept courtesies of this kind from
masculine friends, and I of course understand that circumstances
may arise which make an occasional acceptance proper.
<p>But the fewer such occasions, the better and the safer for the
married woman. The man who is perfectly willing his wife should
appear frequently in public with other men does not fully
appreciate the dignity of her position or his own, or else he has
lost his love for her.
<p>The fact that your husband is jealous without reason is no
excuse for giving him reason. The moment men know that a husband is
inclined to jealousy, he falls in their estimation, and they are
seized with a desire to aggravate him, while they sympathize with
the wife.
<p>The sympathetic friend of the abused wife is a dangerous
companion for her. He may mean to be platonic and kind, but almost
invariably he becomes sentimental and unsafe.
<p>Once in a thousand times the absolutely happy wife of a husband
she respects as well as loves can enjoy a platonic friendship with
a man who respects her, and himself, and her husband. But even that
situation is liable to prove insecure, if they are much together,
owing to the selfishness and weakness of human nature when the
barriers of convention are removed.
<p>But the unhappy wife must take no chances with Fate.
<p>She must either decide to accept her lot and bear it with
philosophy, or escape from it and begin life over, after the courts
have given her the right to reconstruct her destiny.
<p>You know all that entails. It is not a pleasant process.
<p>If your love for your husband is entirely dead, and you feel
that he has forfeited all right to your sympathy, pity, or
patience, then break the fetters and go free. But if you feel that
you are not ready for that ordeal, and that you must still remain
living under the same roof with him, and continue to bear his name,
then do not join the great army of wives who are to be seen in
public restaurants and hotels dining t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te
with "platonic friends" over emptied glasses.
<p>You can but make trouble for yourself and add to the misery of
your husband by such a course. In your particular case, I feel that
your knowledge of the jealous disposition of the man you married
renders it your duty to bear and forbear, and to try every method
of reformation before you resort to the very common highway of
divorce as an exit from your unhappiness.
<p>A woman has no right to complain of the fault in a husband which
she condoned in a lover. And a man has no right to complain of the
fault in a wife he condoned in a sweetheart. Yet both may strive to
correct that fault.
<p>Insist upon having women and men friends who can be received at
your home in presence of your husband. Make Clarence realize how he
belittles himself in your estimation by unreasoning jealousy. Give
him to understand that you want to love him and respect him, and
that you have no intention of lowering your standard of behaviour,
because he is constantly expecting you to. Tell him it mortifies
you to find greater pleasure away from him than in his presence,
yet when he insults you with his suspicions, and destroys your
comfort with his moods, you can no longer think of him as your
girlhood's ideal.
<p>Ask him to try, for your sake, to use more common sense and
self-control in this matter, and to help you to restore the
happiness which seems flying from your wedded lives.
<p>Do nothing to aggravate or irritate him, but do not give up your
friends of either sex; this is but to increase his inclination to
petty tyranny, while it will in no sense lessen his jealousy.
<p>And when you are alone, endeavour to think of him always as
sensible, reasonable, and kind.
<p>By your mental picture you can help to cure him of the blight he
received before his birth. It is the task set many a wife, to
counteract the errors and neglect of mothers.
<p>Look to the Divine source for help in your work, and remember
the lovely qualities Clarence possesses when he is not under the
ban of this prenatal mark.
<p>Love him out into the light if you can&mdash;and I believe you can if
you are not too soon discouraged.
<p>It is a nobler effort to try and create in your husband the
ideal you have in your mind, than to go seeking him elsewhere.
<p>Be patient and wait awhile. Such love as you and Clarence felt
in your courtship and early marriage cannot so soon have died. It
is only sleeping, and suffering from a nightmare. Awaken it to life
and reality and happiness.

<a name="To_Young_Mrs_Duncan"></a>
<h2>To Young Mrs. Duncan</h2>
<p class="c3">Regarding Mothers-in-Law<br>
<p>And so the serpent has appeared in your Eden, attired in widow's
weeds, and talking the usual jargon of "devoted mother love." I do
not like to say I told you so, but you must remember our rather
spirited discussion of this very serpent, when you announced your
engagement and said Mr. Duncan's mother was to make her home with
you after your return from abroad.
<p>I had met Mrs. Duncan, and I knew her type all too well. Alfred
is her only child, and she adores him, naturally, but it is
adoration so mingled with selfishness and tyranny that it is
incapable of considering the welfare of its object.
<p>Mrs. Duncan was always jealous of any happiness which came to
her son through another source than herself. That type of mother
love is to be encountered every day, and that type of mother
believes herself to be the most devoted creature on earth; while
the fact is, she sits for ever in the boudoir of her mentality,
gazing at her own reflection. She loves her children because they
also reflect herself, and is incapable of unselfish pleasure in
their happiness apart from her.
<p>You will remember I urged you to wait until you could have a
home, however humble, alone with your husband, and even at the cost
of that most undesirable condition, a long engagement.
<p>But you assured me with much spirit that you had every
confidence in your power to win Mrs. Duncan's heart, and to crown
her declining years with peace and happiness.
<p>As well talk of decking a porcupine with wreaths of flowers, and
making it a household pet, to coddle and caress.
<p>When I congratulated Mrs. Duncan on her son's engagement to such
a sweet, bright girl as my cousin, she assumed a martyr expression
and said, "She hoped he would be happy, even if her own heart must
suffer the pain of losing an only son."
<p>"But," I urged, "he really adds to your life by bringing you the
companionship of a lovely daughter. My cousin will, I am sure,
prove such to you."
<p>"I have no doubt your cousin is a most estimable girl," Madame
Duncan answered, with dignity, "but I have never yet felt the need
of any close companion save my son. You, having no children, are
excusable for not understanding my feelings, now when another
claims his thoughts."
<p>"Yet the world is maintained by such occurrences," I replied.
"You took some mother's son, or you would not have had your own."
<p>With austere self-righteousness Mrs. Duncan corrected me.
<p>"I married an orphan," she said.
<p>"How thoughtful of you," I responded. "But you see it is not
lack of thought, only an accident of fate, which has prevented my
cousin from marrying an orphan. There are not enough desirable
orphans to keep our young women supplied with husbands, you know."
<p>I think Mrs. Duncan suspected me of covert sarcasm, for she
changed the topic of conversation. But I heard her afterward
talking to a bevy of women on the sorrow of giving up a child after
having reared him to manhood's estate, and her listeners all seemed
duly sympathetic.
<p>Of course, my dear Ruth, there is an element of sadness in the
happiest of marriages for the parents of children. I think it is
particularly sad when a mother gives up a daughter, whose every
thought she has shared, and whose every pleasure she has planned,
and sees her embark upon the uncertain ocean of marriage, with a
strange pilot at the helm.
<p>The really good and loving mother endears herself to that pilot,
and loves him and seeks his affection for her daughter's sake. She
hides her own sorrow in her heart, and does not shadow her
daughter's voyage by her repining.
<p>The man who is worthy of a good girl's love will understand what
it must mean to a mother to give her daughter to him, and he will
in every way seek to recompense her for her loss, by bestowing upon
her sympathy, courteous attentions, and a son's devotion.
<p>Just so will the girl, who is worthy of being a good man's wife,
seek to make his mother love her.
<p>I know how you have tried to win Mrs. Duncan's heart. I know
your amiable, sweet disposition, and your unselfishness and tact,
and I know how you failed.
<p>I can imagine your feelings when you overheard Mrs. Duncan say
to a caller that she was going to leave your house and take rooms
elsewhere, as she could not endure your "billing and cooing."
<p>Do you know, Ruth, that nearly all the trouble between
mothers-and daughters-in-law is due to vanity and jealousy.
<p>Fifty mothers are friends to their daughters' husbands where one
is a friend to her son's wife. That is because, wholly
unconsciously to herself, the mother resents another woman sharing
the attention of a man she loves. The fact that he is her son, and
that the love he gives his wife is a wholly different sentiment,
does not prevent blind, unreasoning jealousy from dominating her
nature.
<p>Mrs. Duncan wants to stand always in the centre of the stage,
with every other woman in the play in the background.
<p>It is a most pathetic situation for a man,&mdash;this position between
a wife and a jealous mother. My heart always aches for the man in
the case even more than for the woman who is misused.
<p>All young men are reared to think mother-love the most unselfish
and wonderful devotion on earth, even in the face of facts which so
often prove it otherwise; and when a son sees his mother unhappy he
is inclined to make every possible excuse for her, because he feels
that to take issue against her will put him in a false light before
the whole established order of society, and that he will beat his
head against traditions wherever he turns.
<p>So, he ofttimes tries to conciliate the wife he has promised to
cherish, and to convince her that she may exaggerate matters, and
that she may even be the aggressor, and then he finds himself
standing between two raging fires, with no escape save through
flames, and over hot fagots, which will leave him scarred for life.
<p>Sometimes the wife <i>is</i> in the wrong. Sometimes a man
marries a woman who is so narrow and so selfish and so jealous that
she begrudges the husband's mother her son's affection. But I must
affirm that, in my observation of humanity, I have seen but one
such wife, where I have seen ten jealous and unreasonable mothers.
<p>And with what pleasure and admiration I recall the few beautiful
and noble mothers-in-law I have known! I can count them on the
fingers of one hand without including the thumb. I mean mothers of
sons.
<p>There are just four whom I can recall. They really loved their
sons, and loved whatever and whoever gave those sons happiness.
<p>One mother objected to her son's choice before marriage, and
tried vainly to convince him that he had made a mistake. But after
his marriage she took the girl into her heart, made her a companion
and friend, and when the son began to discover her glaring faults,
she told him to be patient and wait, and that all would be well.
Instead of saying, "I told you so," she said, "Your wife is young,
and has had no wise hand to guide her. You married her for love,
and if you exercise the love-spirit, and are patient and
self-controlled in your treatment of her, she will overcome these
faults which annoy you."
<p>And day by day she called his attention to the pleasing
qualities the girl possessed, and by praise, tact, love, and
sympathy bridged over the threatened chasm.
<p>The couple live happily together to-day, thanks to the
mother-in-law. Oh, that there were more such mothers of sons!
<p>Be as patient and sweet as you can, dear Ruth, toward Mrs.
Duncan; think how difficult the situation is for your husband, and
say or do nothing to make it harder for him. But allow Mrs. Duncan
to live by herself, and, if need be, bear many privations
cheerfully that she may do so, and that you may have your own home
in peace. Every wife is entitled to that, and if she has made every
possible effort which love and tact can make to cast the seven
devils of jealousy out of her mother-in-law, and they still remain,
it is for the general welfare that two separate households exist.
<p>When a son has done all he can in reason to make his mother
happy, save to turn against the wife he has promised to cherish, he
is a cad and a weakling if he does the latter. He must learn that
it is a larger duty to be a just man than to be an obedient son.
<p>I am sure Mr. Duncan will have the character and judgment to do
what is right in this matter.

<a name="To_a_Young_Man"></a>
<h2>To a Young Man</h2>
<p class="c3">Ambitious for Literary Honours<br>
<p>Your achievements in college, where you distinguished yourself
in rhetoric and literature, would justify you in thinking seriously
of a career as an author.
<p>And the fact that your father wishes you to take charge of his
brokerage business, and to relinquish your literary aspirations,
should not deter you from carrying out your ambitions.
<p>Prom your mother you inherit a mind and temperament which wholly
unfit you for the pursuits your father follows and enjoys. You are
no more suited to make a successful broker than he is fitted to
write an Iliad.
<p>Try and make him understand this, and try and convince him that
to yield to his wishes in this matter, means the sacrifice of your
tastes, the waste of your talents, and the destruction of your
happiness.
<p>If he cannot be convinced by your consistent and respectful
arguments, then you must quietly, but firmly, refuse to accept a
career distasteful to you.
<p>No parent has a right to drive a child into so undesirable a
path for life as this would prove to one of your nature.
<p>Your father would think the horticulturist insane, who took a
delicate fern and planted it in arid soil, on a hilltop, far from
shade, and expected it to thrive and bear blossoms like the cactus.
<p>Yet this would be no more unreasonable, than to expect a son of
your temperament and inclinations to be happy and successful in
Wall Street.
<p>It is a curious study to watch parents, and to observe their
utter lack of knowledge regarding a child's nature and
capabilities; and to find them not only ignorant in those important
matters, but unwilling to be enlightened.
<p>You say it makes your father angry to have any one refer to your
literary talents.
<p>I remember when your father bred race-horses, and how proud he
was that a two-year-old colt showed traits and points noticeably
like its high-priced dam.
<p>He chose for your mother, a woman of rare mind, and of poetic
taste, and why should he not be proud and glad that his son
resembles her? When will fathers learn that sons are more
frequently like their mothers, and daughters like their fathers,
than otherwise?
<p>The temporary dissatisfaction of your father is not so sad to
contemplate as your own lifelong disappointment if you accede to
his wishes in this matter.
<p>Each individual has a right to choose his own career in life, so
long as that career is respectable and bodes no evil to humanity.
<p>If, as your father threatens, he refuses to give you support
while you are exploring the field of literature, you should feel
grateful to him for this unintentional incentive to success.
<p>I do not agree with those who consider the necessity to earn
money a misfortune to genius.
<p>I believe the greatest works of art given to the world have been
brought to light through necessity.
<p>The artistic temperament is almost invariably combined with a
propensity to dream, and to float upon the clouds of imagination.
<p>The ranks of wealth and comfort are full of talented and
accomplished people who "never are, but always to be" great.
<p>One great man in a score may have been reared in affluence, but
I doubt if the statistics would show so large a percentage.
<p>There are many hills which contain valuable ore, but if the
owner sits in ease upon these elevations, and gazes at the sunsets,
he does not find the ore. If he is a poor man, and takes his pick
and <i>digs</i>, he finds his fortune.
<p>At first he may cast out only loose earth and stones, but by
this very necessity to find valuables, he continues to search until
the ore is reached.
<p>Were you to remain at home and enjoy all the benefits of your
father's wealth, I doubt if you would have the persistence to dig
down into the mine you possess within you.
<p>You would sit on the hilltop and dream.
<p>If you are forced to write to live, you may cast up some rubbish
from the surface; yet by the continual digging you will reveal all
that lies below.
<p>Regarding the style you speak of adopting, let your feeling come
<i>first</i>, your style of expressing that feeling <i>second</i>.
Say nothing merely to exhibit your style&mdash;and hold back some strong
feelings until you can give them the best expression.
<p>As to the methods of getting your work before the public and the
"influence" you need, I can only assure you that unless you write
with purpose, and power, and passionate enjoyment of your art,
forgetful of all things save your desire to express yourself, no
influence on earth can do more than give you a page in a magazine,
or a column in a newspaper for an occasion or two. And if you do
write under those conditions, you will need no influence: for it is
just such writing the world wants; and the editors and publishers
will be forced to read you, whether they are inclined to or not.
<p>Christopher Columbus found his continent because he was so
determined, so persistent, so certain that unknown lands awaited
him.
<p>It made no difference who told him that all the earth had been
discovered, and that he would never be able to succeed in his wild
venture. His purpose was too strong to be influenced by the doubts
of others.
<p>It has always seemed to me that God would have made a continent
to reward such a search, had it not already existed.
<p>Unless you set forth on the sea of literature, with the spirit
of a Columbus in your soul, you may as well give up the idea of
finding the Port of Glory. If you do set forth with that spirit,
you need ask no mortal influence.
<p>God is the only influence genius needs.
<p>Perseverance the only method.
<p>To find the way to success alone, is the test of talent.
<p>Some influential author might give you the entre&eacute; once to
a magazine. But editors and publishers are men of purely business
instincts, and they will not accept work on the recommendation of
any third party, which they think their public will not like. Their
constant effort is to find what that public <i>does like</i>, and
the unknown author has an equal advantage with the genius, if he
sends such material.
<p>An author once told me that he "trapped" twenty manuscripts and
sent them out to editors, and all came back unread, as his "trap"
proved.
<p>Since he sent them forth with such doubts in his mind, it is no
wonder his trap succeeded and his manuscripts failed.
<p>No great literary fire of purpose could be in the mind of a man
who spent thought and time on such a plot to trick an editor. And
because there was no great flame, the inanimate manuscripts were
returned unread. For even a package of paper sends out its "aura,"
and invites or repels attention.
<p>If you are discouraged by the people who tell you that
"everything has been written," and that you can only be a faint
echo of greater souls, then you do not deserve success. I have no
doubt the croakers of that day told Shakespeare the same.
<p>It seems that Shakespeare did take many old themes and other
people's plots and ideas to re-create in his own way. And what a
way! Surely he who best uses an idea is most entitled to the
credit.
<p>There is nothing new under the sun, but there is always the new
audience. For the majestic old poem of Spring, bound over in new
covers of green, God creates fresh, eager young eyes and hearts
each year. And not yet has he said to the year, "Do not attempt
another spring&mdash;there have been so many before, you can but repeat
their beauties." Then why should any mortal say to the poet or the
author, "Do not try to write&mdash;it has all been said before."
<p>Proceed, my young friend, and write what is in your heart.
Nothing quite the same was ever in any heart before, and yet the
greater part of it has been in all hearts, and will be in all
hearts, so long as the world lasts.
<p>Remember that when you write from the heart, it will go to the
hearts of your readers: and when you write from your head it will
go no lower than the head.
<p>And if the critics score or ridicule you, consider yourself on
the path to success.
<p>If you have a message for the world, nothing and nobody can
prevent you from delivering it.
<p>He only fails who has nothing to say.

<a name="To_Mrs_McAllister"></a>
<h2>To Mrs. McAllister</h2>
<p class="c3">Concerning Her Little Girl<br>
<p>How strange it seems that your daughter is ten years old.
<p>It is such a brief hour since you wrote me you were eighteen and
had entered Vassar. Having no children of my own to stand as
milestones on life's highway, and keeping a very young heart in my
breast all these years, it seems at times little less than
impertinent in the children I have known to develop so rapidly into
matrons and fathers.
<p>I am glad for you that the doctor has reached the desirable goal
where he can rest from his laborious profession for two years, and
take that journey abroad you have so long contemplated. And I am
glad that you feel the satisfaction you say you do, in never having
left him alone for a whole season as you once thought of doing.
<p>A satisfied conscience is a better comrade to journey along
beside, than a remembered pleasure.
<p>But now about Genevieve.
<p>You tell me she is to be left with your sister, and that she
will, for the first time, attend the public school.
<p>You are right in thinking this will make her more American in
spirit than an education gained through home teaching or private
schools.
<p>The girl who attends private schools only, is almost invariably
inoculated with the serum of aristocracy.
<p>She believes herself a little higher order of being than the
children who attend public schools, and it requires continual
association with people of broad common sense to counteract this
influence. I know you and the doctor have exerted this influence,
but your sister might not realize the necessity of making a special
effort in that direction.
<p>Then, too, since the fathers or grandfathers of our most
conspicuous social leaders were self-made and self-taught, and
since our American society is composed of so many varied types of
humanity, it is well for a young girl to come in contact with all
classes while she is yet a child, that she may understand humanity
as she is sure to encounter it later. Yet, as you say, it is indeed
a serious thought to know your little rosebud of a child is to be
tossed into the dust of the public schoolroom.
<p>"I do not want the delicate leaves forced into premature blossom
or blight," you say, and I feel for you, as I read the words.
<p>You remember your own experience as a school-child in the
country, and you tell me you would fain guard your daughter from
hearing or seeing much that came to your ears and eyes as a
school-child.
<p>But now, my dear Winifred, listen.
<p>It is utterly and absolutely impossible for you to keep
Genevieve ignorant of <i>life</i>, or of the great fundamental
principles of life. It is utterly useless to undertake to ignore
the set impulse in all nature. Since God did not ignore it in
constructing the universe, parents cannot afford to in educating
children. The one thing to do is to teach your child early to
respect and revere the subject, and to regard all things pertaining
to birth as sacred, never to be lightly discussed. Wherever the
eyes of an observing child turn, they see something to arouse
curiosity upon this subject.
<p>All literature (the Bible particularly) contains some reference
to sex and birth. Unless you stuff the ears of children with
cotton, they must hear expressions, suggestions, and references,
which necessitate explanations of the same vital subject. From
insects to man, through all the various kingdoms, sex laws are the
foundation of life.
<p>Why parents have chosen to taboo this important subject, and why
they surround it with falsehood and subterfuge, and suggest that it
is unclean or vulgar, has always puzzled me.
<p>Inconceivable harm, lifelong disaster, has befallen many a girl
and many a boy through this mistaken attitude of parents to God's
basic law of the universe.
<p>Genevieve is only ten. But she is a child with a most inquiring
mind, and she already indicates a tendency to coquetry. She prefers
boys to dolls, and evidently finds them more interesting than
girls.
<p>The things you would guard her from knowing, she is sure to
learn in some undesirable and unfortunate manner, unless you
prepare her for them with loving delicacy and refinement.
<p>My suggestion is that you take a plant, and talk to her about
its growth. Tell her how it springs from a seed, and hides in the
bosom of the earth, expanding until it bursts through, and becomes
the baby of mother earth.
<p>Tell her, too, of the bird life in the egg, and make her realize
the mother-impulse in all nature. Then say to her that she is a
part of it all and that she came into life by the same divine law,
and that when she is older you will explain whatever puzzles her
young mind.
<p>Tell her that she was carried under your heart, as the sprout
was carried in the bosom of mother earth, and that it is a very
holy and beautiful thing; so holy and so beautiful that the refined
and sweet people of the world do not talk freely of the subject,
but keep it like a religion, for those very near to them.
<p>Then say, You will hear other children, who have not been told
this by their mothers, speak rudely and even jest on this subject.
They are to be pitied, for not knowing such jests are vulgar, but
you must walk away from them, and refuse to listen, after telling
them your mother has explained all you need to know. Impress upon
her that she is never to discuss the topic with any one else,
unless you advise her to do so.
<p>I have known only two mothers who took this method with their
children, but both succeeded in rearing beautiful and remarkable
daughters and sons. For the sons were included in the talk by one
mother, and they were ideal boys and gentlemen&mdash;popular with, and
respected by their comrades, in spite of their delicacy and reserve
on subjects jested over by other boys.
<p>I am sure that you can protect Genevieve from the soil and shock
you fear for her, by making her your confidante at this early age,
and by convincing her of your loving companionship in the future.
Under no other conditions would I for one day allow a little girl
(or a little boy for that matter) to attend a public school. Not
one parent in a thousand realizes the moral dangers surrounding
small children who go to and from school in country or city places.
<p>Many remember their own precocious education on forbidden
topics, yet seem to imagine their children will be immune from such
experiences.
<p>But until the Creator produces life by some new process,
children will never be exempt from curiosity regarding the present
method, and parents may as well realize the fact and become their
children's reverent instructors, instead of leaving them to be
taught God's holiest truths by vulgar chance or dreadful design.
<p>Do not imagine that innocence necessitates ignorance.
<p>Your child will be far more innocent minded, if you give her the
instruction I suggest, than if you leave her to ungoverned
imagination and unenlightened observation.
<p>Deep in each human entity the sex impulse is planted, and will
assert itself sooner or later.
<p>Ignorance and curiosity lead often to precocious development of
the impulse. By proper care on your part, your child's mind may be
kept normal, innocent, and wholesome.
<p>See to it that you give this important care before you leave.
<hr class="c2">
<a name="To_Mr_Ray_Gilbert2"></a>
<h2>To Mr. Ray Gilbert</h2>
<p class="c3">Attorney at Law, Aged Thirty<br>
<p>My dear Mr. Gilbert:&mdash;Your letter followed me across the ocean,
and chanced to be the first one opened and read in my weighty home
mail to-day. I have lost all trace of you during the last six
years, in that wonderful way people can lose sight of one another
in a large city. Once or twice I heard you had just left some
social function as I arrived, or was expected just as I was
leaving, and once, recently, I saw you across the house at a first
night, with a very pretty girl at your side. I fancy this is the
"one woman in the world for you," of whom you speak in the letter
before me&mdash;the letter written the evening before your marriage. How
good you are to carry out my request made seven years ago, and to
write me this beautiful letter, after reading over and burning your
former boyish epistle, returning to me my reply.
<p>It is every man's duty to himself, his bride, and the other
woman, to destroy all evidences of past infatuations and
affections, before he enters the new life. It is every woman's duty
to do the same&mdash;<i>with a reservation</i>. Since men demand so much
more of a wife than a wife demands of a husband, a woman is wise to
retain any proof in her possession that some man has been an
honourable suitor for her hand. She should make no use of such
evidence, unless the unaccepted lover indulges in disrespectful
comments or revengeful libels, as some men are inclined to when the
fruit for which they reached is picked by another hand.
<p>And it is when the grapes are called sour that the evidence may
prove effective of their having been thought sweet and desirable.
<p>It is a curious fact that no woman thinks less of a man for his
having had his vain infatuations, and that all men think less of a
woman if she has loved without response.
<p>Therefore, it behoves her to destroy no evidence that the other
man, not herself, was the discarded party.
<p>But woe unto the man who retains old love-letters, or other
tokens of dead loves and perished desires.
<p>Few men could be guilty of showing or repeating the contents of
another man's love-letters. Women who are models of virtue and
goodness have been known to make public the letters written a man
in earlier years by another object of his affections. I have to my
personal knowledge known a woman to place before the eyes of a
third person, lines written evidently in the very heart's blood of
a former sweetheart of her husband-words the man believed he had
destroyed with other letters, more than a score of years before.
Imagine what the feelings of that early sweetheart, now a happy and
beloved wife, would be, did she know the words written so long ago
were spread before cold and critical eyes, and discussed by two
people who could have no comprehension of the conditions and
circumstances which led to their expression.
<p>Because I know otherwise tender-hearted and good women are
capable of such acts, I am glad you have obeyed my wish of seven
years ago, and that all proofs of your boyish infatuation for an
older woman are destroyed. You say you have told the girl you love
that you once were foolishly fond of me, and that I helped you to
higher ideals of womanhood and life.
<p>That is wise and well, since you found her to be broad and
sensible enough to share such a confidence. But had she seen your
written words to me and my reply, it would have been less agreeable
to her than to hear your own calm recital of the now dead passion.
<p>Words written in a state of high-wrought intensity retain a sort
of phosphoric luminosity, like certain decaying substances, and
even after the passage of years, and when the emotions which gave
them expression are dead and forgotten, they seem to emit life and
feeling.
<p><i>Burn your bridges as you walk along the highways of romance
to St. Benedict's land</i>.
<p>Since you compliment me by saying I have helped you to higher
ideals of life, will you allow me to give you a little advice
regarding your treatment of your wife?
<p>You have every reason to know that I have been a happy and
well-loved wife of the man of my choice. You know that I have
neither sought nor accepted the attentions of other men when they
crossed the danger-line lying between friendship and love.
<p>Therefore it may astonish you when I confess that, at the time
you temporarily lost your head, I was conscious of an undercurrent
of feminine vanity at the thought that I was capable of inspiring a
young and talented man with so sincere a feeling.
<p>A similar experience with an older man would have suggested an
insult, since older men understand human nature, and realize what a
flirtation with a married woman means. But your ingenuousness, and
your romantic, boyish temperament, were, in a measure, an excuse
for your folly, and made me lenient toward you.
<p>My happy life, my principles and ideals, submerged this
sentiment of feminine vanity to which I confess, but I knew it was
there, and it led me to much meditation, then and ever since, upon
the matter of woman's weakness and folly.
<p>As never before, I was able to understand how a neglected or
misused wife might mistake this very sentiment of flattered vanity
for the recognition of an affinity.
<p>Had I been suffering from coldness and indifference at home, how
acceptable your boyish devotion might have proved to me.
<p>And how easily I would have been persuaded by your blind
reasoning that we were intended by an all-wise Providence for life
companions.
<p>There is no sin a woman so readily forgives as a man's unruly
love for her, and hundreds of noble-hearted women have been led to
regard a lawless infatuation as a divine emotion, because they were
lonely, and neglected, and hungry for affection.
<p>See to it, my dear friend, as the years go by, that your wife
needs no romance from the outside world to embellish her life with
sentiment.
<p>Do not drop into the humdrum ways of many contented husbands,
and forget to pay the compliment, and cease to act the lover.
<p>Notice the gowns and hats your wife wears, and share her
pleasures and interests when it is possible.
<p>Not that you should always be together, for separate enjoyments
and occupations sometimes lend an added zest to life for husband
and wife, but do not drift apart in all your ideas and interests,
as have so many married people.
<p>You are the husband of a bright and lovely girl, and if you
forget this fact after a time, remember there are other Ray
Gilberts who may realize it, and seek to awaken such an interest in
her heart as you sought to arouse in mine.
<p>You found the room occupied by its rightful host.
<p>See it that no man finds the room vacant in your wife's heart.
<p>Study the art of keeping your wife interested and interesting.
<p>A woman thrives on love and appreciation. I know a beautiful
bride of eighty years, who has been the daily adoration of her
husband for more than half a century.
<p>She has been "infinite in her variety," and he has never failed
to appreciate and admire.
<p>Devote a portion of each day to talking to your wife about
herself.
<p>Then she will not find it a novelty when other men attempt the
same method of entertainment.
<p>Whatever other matters engross your time and attention, let your
wife realize that she stands first and foremost in your thoughts
and in your heart.
<p>Do not forget the delicacies of life, manner, speech, and
deportment in the intimacy of daily companionship.
<p>Never descend to the vulgar or the commonplace.
<p>One characteristic of men has always puzzled me. No matter how
wide has been a bachelor's experience with the wives and daughters
of other men, when he marries it never occurs to him that his wife
or daughters could meet temptation or know human weakness.
<p>It must be the egotism of the sex.
<p>Each man excuses the susceptibility of the women with whom he
has had romantic episodes, on the ground of his especial power or
charm. And when he marries, he believes his society renders all the
women of his family immune from other attractions.
<p>Do not rely upon the fact that your wife is legally bound to
you, and therefore need not be wooed by you hereafter.
<p>There are women who are born anew with each dawn, and who must
be won anew with each day, or the lover loses some precious quality
than can never be regained.
<p>It will pay you to study your wife as the years pass.
<p>Do not take for granted that you know her to-day, because you
knew her thoroughly last year.
<p>This is a long letter, but when one writes only once in seven
years, brevity is not to be expected.
<p>My greeting to you, and may the years be weaver's hands, which
shall interlace and bind two lives into one complete pattern.

<a name="To_the_Sister_of_a_Great_Beauty"></a>
<h2>To the Sister of a Great Beauty</h2><br>
<p>I am far from laughing, my dear girl, at your assertion that
your position is little short of tragic.
<p>To be the ordinary sister of an extraordinary beauty, is a
position which calls for the exercise of all the great virtues in
order to be borne with dignity, good taste, and serenity.
<p>I remember seeing you and Pansy when you were ten and she twelve
years of age. I foresaw what lay before you then, and have often
wondered how you would meet the occasion when you were both
"finished," and at home under the same roof, and socially launched.
It was wise for your mother to separate you so early in life, and
place you under different teachers, and in different schools.
<p>It is difficult for a girl in her late childhood and early teens
to use philosophy and religion to support her, when she is made a
Cinderella by unthinking associates and friends, and forgotten and
neglected while a more attractive sister is lionized.
<p>Had you always walked in the shadow of your handsome sister
until to-day, I fancy your disposition would have become warped
with resentment and envy.
<p>And perhaps your feelings for Pansy would have been less
affectionate than now.
<p>I am glad to have you tell me that Pansy is so modest and
unassuming and so genuinely solicitous for your happiness.
<p>She must have been particularly fortunate in her environment
while at school to possess such qualities after knowing as she has
known for twenty-two years that her beauty is dazzling to the eye
of even the chance beholder.
<p>There is no greater obstacle to the development of the best
qualities in a young woman than the possession of such unusual
beauty. From her cradle she is made to realize its power, and men
and women teach her in a thousand unconscious ways to be selfish
and self-centred. She receives attentions, and her acquaintance is
sought, with no effort on her part, while more gifted and deserving
companions are unnoticed. She is made to realize that she is one to
be served, where less attractive girls are taught to "stand and
wait."
<p>The love nature of each human being is either developed or
stunted by neglect during the early years of life, and, as a rule,
the beautiful woman is incapable of a deep, absorbing, and
unselfish love, because she has grown up the receiver instead of
the giver.
<p>Were you, my dear Sallie, to know the number of great beauties
who have failed to find happiness in marriage, you would be amazed.
But the explanation is simple; for man is a being who, however he
may worship beauty before marriage, worships his own comfort more
deeply afterward. And it is rare indeed when a famous beauty
troubles herself to plan for the comfort or happiness of the man
she marries. It is the natural result of her education to think man
made to adore and serve her.
<p>I hope Pansy may keep her loving and lovable qualities, and that
she may marry before the adoration and admiration of many men
become necessary to her life. For the beauties' matrimonial barque
most often founders on the reef of plural lovers.
<p>As for yourself, I can only suggest that you acquire many
accomplishments, and perfect yourself in music and languages, and
that you seek for the attainment of all the subtle graces, which
are, in the long run, more lasting as sources of happiness for a
woman than mere beauty. It is a peculiarly significant fact that
the great passions of history have not been inspired by very young
or startlingly beautiful women, but by those of maturity and mental
charms.
<p>Cleopatra, Helen of Troy, Aspasia, Petrarch's Laura, had all
crossed the line between youth and middle life, and there are no
authentic proofs that any one of the number was a dazzling beauty.
Some of the world's most alluring women have been absolutely plain.
<p>You are not plain. It is only by comparison that you so regard
yourself.
<p>There is much you can do to make yourself more attractive
personally. You know what Rochefoucauld said: "No woman is in fault
for not being beautiful at sixteen; any woman is in fault if she is
not beautiful at forty."
<p>However much it may sound like a platitude, it is a great and
eternal truth that your mental activities are chiselling your
features. By keeping yourself concerned with good, gracious, and
great thoughts, you are shaping your face into a noble beauty
minute by minute, and hour by hour.
<p>Avoid as much as possible looking at repulsive and ugly objects.
<p>Look at whatever is beautiful and seek for it.
<p>Search for whatever is admirable in nature and human nature, and
muse upon those things in your moments of solitude.
<p>Cultivate love-thoughts for humanity at large.
<p>Avoid severe criticisms, and develop sympathy and pity in your
soul. Study the comfort and pleasure of strangers in public places,
and friends and associates in nearer relations.
<p>Remember always how brief a thing, and ofttimes sad, life is to
many, and seek to brighten and better it as you pass along.
<p>Meanwhile, take care of your person, study your lines and your
features, and learn how to dress and how to carry yourself; how to
obtain "presence," that indescribable charm in woman.
<p>Take daily care of your complexion, which to a woman is of prime
importance.
<p>Call in the skill of the specialist to help you preserve and
beautify your skin and hair, just as the dentist and the oculist
are to be consulted to help you preserve teeth and eyes. Think
beauty for mind, soul, and body; live it, and believe it is your
right.
<p>And just as surely as you pursue this line of conduct for ten
years, just so surely will you find yourself at thirty far more
attractive than at twenty, and at forty more lovely than at thirty.
Learn to be a linguist, and acquire skill upon some one instrument,
that you may entertain those who care to converse, and give
pleasure to those who wish to be silent.
<p>You are young, and life with its splendid possibilities is
before you. There is nothing a woman with youth, will-power, and
<i>love</i> may not accomplish&mdash;even to the convincing of the world
that she is beautiful, when her mirror may say otherwise.
<p>For enduring and all-encompassing beauty is a composite thing,
and unless a woman possesses the spiritual and mental portions, the
physical phase soon loses its attractions for the cultivated eye;
while with the development of the first two, the third is certain
to come.
<p>Begin to-day, my dear girl, to <i>grow beauty</i> which shall
make you a power and an influence in the world where you move, and
which shall invite, rather than fear, the approach of time.

<a name="To_Mrs_White_Peak"></a>
<h2>To Mrs. White Peak</h2>
<p class="c3">One of the Pillars of Respectable Society<br>
<p>Ever since your call and our conversation regarding Sybyl
Marchmont, I have felt a rising tide of indignation. It has reached
the perigee mark and must overflow. If it reaches you and gives you
a thorough soaking, I shall feel satisfied.
<p>I have always known you were only half-developed. There are many
such people in the world. They serve their purpose and often do
much good. They miss a great deal of life, but as they rarely know
that they miss anything, it is a waste of sentiment to pity them.
<p>I have pitied you, nevertheless. I have often wished I could
give you the vital qualities you lack.
<p>My pity turned to indignation when I heard you express yourself
in such unqualified terms of condemnation regarding other women who
happened to be unlike you in temperament.
<p>You say there is a certain line which no well-born and womanly
woman can pass in thought or feeling or action.
<p>You regard the true women of earth as a higher and rarer order
of creation than the best of men, and any woman who by action or
word confesses herself to be quite human in her temperament, you
feel is, to a certain extent, "unclean and unsexed." You believe
the really good women of earth are always on a plane above and
beyond the physical. When any woman falls from her pedestal you
despise her.
<p>How dare you, madam, sitting in your cold, white chastity, lay
down laws of what you consider purity, morality, and cleanliness,
for other human souls?
<p>How dare you condemn those who do not reach your standard?
<p>What do you know of life, great, palpitating, throbbing, vital
life, terrible and beautiful life, terrible while passing through
the valleys of temptation, beautiful upon the heights of
self-control?
<p>How dare you assume greater virtue, greater respectability,
greater fineness of sentiment, than the tempest-tossed,
passion-beaten souls, about you?
<p>What do you know of real virtue, real strength?
<p>You have been poor, you tell me, in worldly riches, and you have
been lonely, yet you have never once degraded your womanhood by an
"unworthy " impulse. Never known a temptation of the senses. Those
things disgusted you.
<p>You have preferred toil to taking favours from inferiors, and
you have kept yourself clean in thought, word, and deed, and now
you have the reward of such virtues&mdash;a good home, a husband, and
children.
<p>You are a more devoted mother than wife, as you have always
dwelt upon a lofty white peak of chaste womanhood, from which any
descent into the earthly realms of life and love was repugnant&mdash;so
rarely "pure" and high your nature.
<p>Yet you have been a dutiful, loyal wife, and you are a devoted
mother.
<p>You despise all carnal-minded women, and cannot understand how
women fall&mdash;save that they lack good birth and breeding.
<p>You will aid in a benefit for their reformation, but you do not
want to see them or to come near them. It makes you ill.
<p>You are to be congratulated on never having added to the evil in
the world.
<p>But permit me, madam, to tell you some truths about yourself&mdash;and
the large army of "respectable women" you represent.
<p>However "well born" you may be, you are only half-born. The
complete human being has three sides to his nature&mdash;spiritual,
mental, physical.
<p>The men and women who are evenly developed on the three sides
are few. This is sometimes their fault&mdash;sometimes their misfortune.
<p>We all pity the human being who is mentally dwarfed. We are
sorry for the one whose spiritual nature is undeveloped.
<p>But why should the many women who are devoid of the physical
qualities of human nature presume to lay claim to perfection and to
regard the normal woman as a suspicious character?
<p>You have a fine, active mind, a highly spiritual nature, but you
are stunted in strong, physical emotion. You are incapable of it,
and pride yourself upon the fact.
<p>If that pleases you, well and good.
<p>But how dare you criticize God's <i>complete human</i> beings,
who feel the great vibrations of the universe, who glow and thrill
with that divine creative force, who live a thousand lives and die
a thousand deaths before they learn the glory of self-conquest.
<p>How dare you shrink even from those who fall by the wayside, and
call your shrinking "purity"!
<p>Let me ask you another question:
<p>How dare you turn away from that girl who went through the door
of the Magdalene Home you helped establish, with her fatherless
child in her arms?
<p>She fell from woman's holy estate!
<p>Yes, through mad love for a man&mdash;she loved him with her soul, her
mind, her body. She lacked knowledge, balance, and wisdom; she had
only love and passion.
<p>And you, madam, how about <i>your</i> children?
<p>They were born of a "dutiful" wife. You descended from your
lofty altitude unwillingly&mdash;only at duty's call. You are so
"refined," yet you are a loving mother and pose as the highest type
of woman.
<p><i>God never made in his whole universe of worlds such a "duty"
as unwilling motherhood</i>. Motherhood without the call of sex for
sex is indecent&mdash;criminal. You, too, madam, <i>fell</i>.
<p>That girl in yonder "home" your "charity" helped establish, who
loved unwisely, fell. Her fall was through love&mdash;yours through a
legal ceremony.
<p>All the churches, all the religions and the laws of earth,
cannot make motherhood holy and right without the mutual mental,
spiritual, and physical union of two beings.
<p>Heaven and earth <i>both</i> must sanction a child's conception
to produce a "well-born" soul.
<p>There is no greater sin on earth than the creation of a human
life without complete accord of the creators.
<p>No wonder the world is full of miserable half-born beings, when
mothers like <i>you</i> claim to be the Madonnas of earth.
<p>No wonder natural, complete, striving souls hide their true
natures under a false exterior, when women like <i>you</i> rule
church and society.
<p>What shame or degradation is there, pray, in being animate with
the all-pervading impulse which underlies the entire universe?
Every planet, every tree, every flower, every insect, is the result
of sex seeking sex, atom calling atom.
<p>The universe <i>is</i> because of the law of sex attraction.
<p>And you, poor, puny, pallid woman, dare decry and despise that
law, and dare insult God's animate creature!
<p>Know this, madam, there is no strength worth boasting that has
not conquered weakness. No virtue worth the name that has not
conquered temptation. No greatness of character that has not
overcome unworthy impulses.
<p>Enjoy your negative goodness and be glad you are "good."
<p>Morality is acceptable to the world, however it conies; but dare
not sit in judgment on other human beings fighting battles whose
smoke never reaches your nostrils, striving for heights of which
you never even dream, and who meanwhile have missed certain
degradations which you seem to consider creditable achievements.
<p>Madam, I bid you adieu. That word means "I commend you to God,"
the God who made the two sexes, and intended love to unite them.
<p>May He enlighten you in other lives, if not in this.
<hr class="c2">
<a name="To_Maria_Owens"></a>
<h2>To Maria Owens</h2>
<p class="c3">A New Woman Contemplating Marriage<br>
<p>Surprise, I am free to confess, was my dominant emotion on
reading your letter. Marriage and Maria had never associated
themselves in my mind, fond as I am of alliteration.
<p>Never in the ten years I have known you have I heard you devote
ten minutes to the subject of any man's good qualities. You always
have discoursed upon men's faults and vices, and upon their
tendency, since the beginning of time, to tyrannize over woman. I
was unable to disprove many of your statements, for I know the
weight of argument is upon your side, even while I boldly confess
my admiration and regard for men, as a class, is greater than that
for women.
<p>The fact that the world has allowed men such latitude, and such
license, and made them pay such very small penalties, comparatively
speaking, for very large offences, causes me to admire their
wonderful achievements in noble living all the more: and to place
the man of unblemished reputation and unquestioned probity on a
pedestal higher than any I could yet ask builded for woman.
<p>It is more difficult to be great before the extended tentacles
of the self-indulgence octopus than in the face of oppression and
danger. When the laws of the land and the sentiment of the people
permit a man to be selfish, licentious, tyrannical, and yet call
him great if he accomplishes heroic deeds, it proves what intrinsic
worth must lie in the nature of those who attain the heights of
unselfishness and benevolence, and martyrdom, asking no reward and
often receiving none until posterity bestows it.
<p>Those who can take the broad road of selfishness unmolested, and
choose the narrow path of high endeavour instead, seem to me
greater than those who overcome mere externals.
<p>Many such men have existed, and the steady, slow, but certain
progress of the world from barbarism to civilization, from accepted
cannibalism and slavery to ideals of brotherhood, we owe to them.
All new discoveries, all greatest achievements are due to men.
Woman, I know, has been handicapped and oppressed for centuries by
superstitions, and traditions, and unjust laws; but it is unfair to
ignore the bright, and see only the dark side of the picture, which
the centuries have painted for us, on the background of time.
<p>This letter is only a r&eacute;sum&eacute; of many conversations
between you and me, and it leads up to the explanation of why I am
somewhat dazed and stunned by your announcement that marriage is a
possible event in your near future.
<p>My self-conceit in regard to my knowledge of human nature every
now and then receives a blow. So soon as I have arrived at a
positive conviction that I understand any human being thoroughly,
and feel that I can safely predict what that person will or will
not do, I usually meet some such bewildering experience as this.
<p>I would have laughed at any one who suggested the possibility of
your considering a proposition of marriage.
<p>You tell me you are thirty-five years old, and say you have
never before met the man to whom your thoughts reverted, no matter
how you endeavoured to occupy yourself with other subjects. You
also tell me "he is not like other men." These two statements are
wonderfully familiar to me, indeed they have been confided to me in
precisely the same words by at least a score of women, young and
not so young, who met the compelling man. <i>Maria, I believe you
are in love</i>. Your heart is awakened from its stupor, caused by
an overdose of intellect. For too much intellect is often a drug
which deadens the consciousness of a woman's heart. But you have
been drugged so long that you are still under a hazy spell, to
judge from that portion of your letter which took the form of an
inquiry.
<p>You ask my opinion in regard to the point of disagreement
between you and your semi-fianc&eacute;. To much that you say I
agree. You have carved a name and a place for yourself in the
world. Your lectures, and your books, have made your name familiar
to many people. Your lover is unknown to the public, a man in the
private walks of life. Therefore you think if he loves you as he
should to become your husband, he ought to give up his own name and
take yours, or at least add yours to his own. You assure me it is
merely a matter of habit, that women have obliterated themselves on
the altar of marriage, and that it is time a new order was
instituted. You think the hour calls for pioneers to establish new
boundaries, in a new world where woman will be allowed to keep her
individuality after marriage. Meantime your lover does not feel
that you really love him, when you ask him to take this somewhat
radical step for your sake, or for the sake of all women, as you
put it.
<p>And there you both stand, with only this ridiculous barrier
between you and happiness.
<p>You are still influenced by the intellectual drug, and it
hinders your heart from following out its best impulses. You have
not yet learned more than the A B C of love, or you would know that
the greatest happiness in loving lies in sacrifice. To take and not
give, to gain something and give up nothing, is not loving. Now I
think I hear you saying, "But why should not my lover give this
proof of devotion as well as I? Why should not he be ready to
sacrifice a tradition, and a name, to please me? Why am I more
unloving, or selfish, than he, to refuse to give up my name?"
<p>My answer follows.
<p>Any woman who asks a man to give up his name and take hers
(unless some great legal matter which involves the property rights
of others hangs on so doing) asks him to make himself ridiculous in
the eyes of the world. She indicates, also, that her family name
and her own achievements are dearer to her than his. No woman loves
a man enough to be happy as his wife, if he is not dearer to her
than any mere personal success, however great.
<p>The man who asks a woman to take his name obeys a tradition and
a custom, to be sure, and the woman who accepts it does not display
any especially heroic trait. Therefore, what you demand of your
lover is a far greater proof of devotion than what he asks of you.
No woman who fully understood the meaning of love could ask this of
her future husband. If he occupied the place in her life which a
husband should, no matter what were her personal attainments, she
would glory in adding his name to her own, and in having its
shelter to hide under at times from the glare of publicity.
<p>Should you choose to keep your name Maria Owens with no
addition, for your lectures and your books, it is quite probable
your husband would not object. And again, if your achievements are
worth the thought you give them in this matter, they are great
enough to endure even should you add the name of Chester to that of
Owens. But certainly, if you love the man you think of marrying,
you will be happy in the thought of wearing his name legally and
socially in every-day life, and the sight of a card engraved, "Mrs.
Rupert Chester," will give your heart a sweeter thrill than it has
ever known in connection with the newspaper notices of Maria Owens.
<p>Unless you can arouse your heart to such an understanding of
love, you are not yet acquainted with the little god. If your lover
consents to the sacrifice you have demanded, he will indicate a
weakness of character which augurs ill for the future: and if you
insist upon the sacrifice, you will establish a selfish precedent
which can only make you a tyrant in your own domain, and at the
same time belittle your husband in the public eye.
<p>However proud and happy you may be in the thought of noble
achievements of your own, you must realize that there are many
brutal and painful phases to a public career for a woman. These
phases do not exist to any such degree for a man. I do not believe
it is the result of tradition or habit, but of sex and temperament,
that this difference exists, and that the shelter of a man's name
means more to woman than any shelter to be found in her own, and
that the sacrifice of her own name means less to her than the
sacrifice of his means to him. Unless you can reach this same
conclusion, do not marry&mdash;for you do not love.
<hr class="c2">
<a name="To_Mrs_St_Claire"></a>
<h2>To Mrs. St. Claire</h2>
<p class="c3">The Young Divorc&eacute;e<br>
<p>And so you have joined the increasing army of the
divorc&eacute;es.
<p>It is worse than useless to discuss again the causes which led
to this situation, and now that the law of the land has made you a
free woman, the one thing for you to consider is your future, and
to formulate to some degree a code of conduct for your guidance.
<p>You are in the prime of beautiful womanhood, pleasing to the
eye, and agreeable to the mind. Women will regard you with more or
less mental reservation, and men will seek you at every
opportunity.
<p>Some witty creature has said, "A little widow is a dangerous
thing."
<p>It might be added, "A grass widow whets the appetites of
bovines".
<p>You will find yourself at a loss to choose when an escort is
needed, so many and persistent will be the applicants for the
position.
<p>After having passed through the black waters of an unhappy
marriage, this sudden freedom and return to the privileges of
girlhood will be liable to affect you like the glare of sunlight
after confinement in a dark room.
<p>You will be blinded for a time. It would be well for you to walk
slowly, and to use a cane of common sense, and even to feel your
way with the outstretched hands of discretion, until you become
accustomed to the light.
<p>To fall and scar yourself now, would be a disaster.
<p>It is a curious fact that a woman who has been unhappy with one
man usually finds many others ready to give her the opportunity for
a repetition of her experience. And it is equally curious that one
unhappy marriage frequently leads to another.
<p>A disastrous rencontre with Hymen seems to destroy a woman's
finer intuitions. If you feel that you must marry again, go slowly,
and wait until the bruised tendrils of your heart have healed and
are rooted in healthy soil. Do not let them twine about any sort of
a dead tree or frail reed. Run no chance of a second sorrow.
<p>One divorce always contains elements of tragedy. A second
becomes a farce.
<p>You tell me that you and your former husband entertain the
kindest feeling for each other. You have seen him and talked with
him on several occasions, and you regard him as a friend. You say
all love and sentiment perished long before your separation, and
that to continue as his wife was to die a thousand deaths daily.
<p>You tell me that your own higher development demanded this
separation. I know such situations do exist in the world of men and
women, and that to submit to them is a crime. Yet I also know that
this idea of "development" is used often as a cloak for all sorts
of selfish impulses and moods.
<p>Many men and women to-day seem to forget that certain other
objects besides happiness enter into self-development.
<p>It is not only the pilot who deserts the ship and swims ashore
who saves his life. The one who keeps his hand on the wheel, and
his eye on the lighthouse, he, too, sometimes saves his own life,
as well as saves the ship.
<p>But since to jump overboard was the only way to save your own
life, now that you are ashore, and dry, and comfortable, your first
consideration should be to avoid falling into mires and pits as you
go along.
<p>Though romance died out of your marriage, do not let it die out
of your heart. It is commendable that you feel no bitterness or
resentment toward your husband. But do not carry your kindly
feelings toward him to the extent of frequent association and
comradeship.
<p>Outside of criminal situations, life offers no more ghastly and
unpleasant picture than that of dead passion galvanized into a
semblance of friendship, and going about the world devoid of the
strong elements of either sentiment.
<p>There is something radically wrong with a woman's ideals when
she does not feel an instinctive unwillingness to be thrown with
the man from whom she has been divorced.
<p>There is something akin to degeneracy in the man or woman who
can contemplate without shrinking the intimate encounter of legally
parted husbands or wives.
<p>The softening of the human brain is a terrible malady.
<p>Quite as terrible is the hardening of the human heart.
<p>The loss of happiness is deemed a tragedy. But far greater is
the tragedy when the illusive charm of romance departs, and love
and marriage are reduced to the commonplace. Unless you find the
man who carries your whole nature by storm, and who makes you feel
that life without him will be insupportable, do not be led again to
the altar of marriage.
<p>Life has many avenues for a bright and charming woman which lead
to satisfaction and peace, if not to happiness.
<p>If you desire to be a picturesque figure in the world, remember
that the divorced woman who never marries again is far more so than
she who has taken the names of two living men.
<p>And remember how much there is in life to do for other people,
how much there is to achieve, and how much there is to enjoy, for
the woman who has eyes wherewith to see, and ears with which to
hear.
<p>Life is a privilege, even to the unhappy. It allows them the
opportunity to display the great qualities which God implanted in
every soul, and to give the world higher examples of character.
<p>He who leaves such an example to the world earns happiness for
eternity.

<a name="To_Miss_Jessie_Harcourt"></a>
<h2>To Miss Jessie Harcourt</h2>
<p class="c3">Regarding Her Marriage with a Poor Young Man<br>
<p>And so there is trouble in the house of Harcourt, my dear
Jessie. You want to marry your intellectual young lover, who has
only his pen between him and poverty, and your cruel father, who
owns the town, says it is an act of madness on your part, and of
presumption on his.
<p>And you are thinking of going to the nearest clergyman and
defying parental authority.
<p>You have even looked at rooms where you believe you and Ernest
could be ideally happy. And you want me to act as matron-of-honour
at that very informal little wedding.
<p>Now, my dear girl, before you take this important step, give the
matter careful study.
<p>Your impulses are beautiful, and your ideal natural and lovely.
God intended men and women to choose their mates in this very way,
with no consideration of a worldly nature to mar their happiness.
<p>But civilized young ladies are a far call from God's primitive
woman. You have lived for twenty-three years in the lap of modern
luxury. Your father prides himself upon the fact that, although
your mother died when you were very young, he has carefully
shielded you from everything which could cast a shadow upon your
name or nature. Your lover is fascinated with your absolute purity
and innocence. Yet he does not realize that a young woman who has
so long "sat in the lap of Luxury," is unfit to be a poor man's
wife.
<p>Some girl who might know much more than you of the dark and
vulgar side of life, would make him a better companion if he could
love her enough to ask her hand in marriage.
<p>The girl who has received the addresses of this fascinating old
fellow "Luxury," never quite forgets him, or ceases to bemoan him
if she throws him over for a poor man.
<p>To <i>look</i> at two rooms and a bath is one thing, to
<i>live</i> in them another, after having all your life occupied a
suite which a queen might envy, with retinues of servitors at call.
<p>You tell me you could die for your lover.
<p>But can you bathe from a wash-bowl and pitcher, and can you take
your meals at cheap restaurants, and make coffee and toast on an
oil-stove or a chafing-dish?
<p>Can you wear cheap clothing and ride in trolleys, and economize
on laundry bills to prove your love for this man?
<p>You never have known one single hardship in your life; you never
have faced poverty, or even experienced the ordinary economies of
well-to-do people.
<p>You are an only daughter of wealth&mdash;<i>American wealth</i>. That
sentence conveys a world of meaning. <i>It means that you are
spoiled for anything but comfort in this life</i>.
<p>For a few weeks you might believe yourself in a fairy-land of
romance if you married your lover and went to live in the two
rooms. But at the end of that period you would begin to realize
that you were in a very actual land of poverty and discomfort.
<p>Discomfort is relative. Those rooms to the shop-girl who had
toiled for years, and lived in a fourth-flight-back tenement, would
represent luxury. To you, after a few months, they would mean
absolute penury.
<p>You would begin to miss your beautiful home, and your maids, and
your carriages. Your husband would know you were missing them, and
he would be miserable. Unless your father came to your rescue, your
dream of romantic love would end in a nightmare of regret and
sorrow.
<p>Your father knows you,&mdash;the creature of refined tastes and
luxurious habits that he has made you,&mdash;and your lover does not.
Neither do you know yourself.
<p>It requires a woman in ten thousand, one possessed of absolute
heroism, like the old martyrs who sang at the stake while dying, to
do what you contemplate, and to be happy in the doing.
<p>Nothing like a life of self-indulgence disintegrates great
qualities. You are romantically and feverishly in love with a
handsome and gifted young man. But do not rush into a marriage with
him until you can bring your father to settle a competence upon
you, or until your lover has spanned the abyss of poverty with a
bridge of comfort. You have had no training in self-denial or
self-dependence. The altar is a bad place to begin your first
lesson.
<p>Wait awhile. I know my advice seems worldly and cold, but it is
the result of wide observation.
<p>If you cannot sit in your gold and white boudoir, and be true to
Ernest while he battles a few more years with destiny, then you
could not remain loyal in thought while you held your numb fingers
over a chilly radiator in an uncomfortable flat, or omitted dessert
from your dinner menu to cut down expenses.
<p>Your brain-cells have been developed in opulence.
<p>You could not train your mind to inexorable economy, even at the
command of Cupid.
<p>Take the advice of a woman of the world, my dear girl, and do
not attempt the impossible and so spoil two lives.
<p>Again I say, wait awhile.
<p>There are girls who could be perfectly happy in the position you
picture for yourself with Ernest, but not you.
<p>Better hide your ideal in your heart than shatter it on the
unswept hearthstone of the commonplace.
<p>Better be in your lover's life the unattained joy, than ruin his
happiness by discontent.
<p>It is less of a tragedy for a man to hear a woman say "I cannot
go with you," than to hear her say "I cannot stay with you."
<hr class="c2">
<a name="To_Miss_Jane_Carter"></a>
<h2>To Miss Jane Carter</h2>
<p class="c3">Of the W.C.T.U.<br>
<p>And so, my dear Jane, I have fallen from my pedestal, in your
estimation. Yet, having carefully regarded myself in the mirror,
and finding no discolorations, and feeling no wounds or contusions,
I think my pedestal must have been very near the earth, else I
would be conscious of some bruises.
<p>And now, Jane, to be frank, I am very glad to be off my perch.
<p>I do not want to dwell upon a pedestal.
<p>It necessitates a monotonous life, and it is an unsocial
position.
<p>I prefer to walk on the earth, among my fellow creatures.
<p>You were greatly shocked, I saw, when I told my little Russian
guest that she might light her cigarette in my boudoir. Your sudden
departure told its own story, and your letter was no surprise. But
I am glad you wrote me so frankly, as it gives me the opportunity
to be equally frank.
<p>There is nothing more beneficial, in true friendship, than a
free exchange of honest criticisms.
<p>You tell me that I lowered my standard by lending countenance to
a pernicious and unladylike habit. You felt I owed it to myself, as
a good woman, and to my home, as a respectable house, to show my
unswerving principles in this matter, and to indicate my
disapproval of a disgusting vice, which is growing in our midst.
<p>Life is too short, my dear Jane, in which to achieve all our
ideals, and to arrive at all our goals.
<p>I have learned the futility of attempting to reform the whole
world in one day. And I have also learned that there are more roads
than one, to all destinations.
<p>Miss Ordosky is the daughter of a dear old friend of my youth,
who married a Russian nobleman with more titles than dollars.
<p>Her parents are dead, and Wanda has come to her mother's native
land, to teach her father's language. She has come with all her
Russian habits and ideas accented by her mother's American
indifference to public opinion. The girl is young, lovely, and
wholly dependent upon herself for a livelihood. I invited her to be
my guest for two months, before establishing herself in her
business, with the hope of helping her to adapt herself somewhat to
American ideas and customs.
<p>I could never hope for such a result, had I antagonized her the
first day under my roof by an austere attitude toward a habit which
I knew she had been reared to think proper.
<p>I do not like to see a woman smoke, and I regret as much as you
do the increasing prevalence of the vice in America.
<p>Like almost every schoolgirl, I had my day of thinking a
surreptitious, cigarette was wonderfully cunning.
<p>That day passed, like the measles and the whooping-cough, and
left me immune. I have never seen a woman so beautiful and alluring
that she was not less charming when she put a cigarette to her
lips. I am confident the habit vitiates the blood, injures the
digestion, and renders the breath offensive. I have known many
American men who taught their wives to smoke; and I do not know
<i>one</i> who has not lived to regret it, when the cigarette he
fancied would be an occasional luxury became a necessity.
<p>A woman who expects ever to bring children into the world, is
little better than a criminal to form such a habit: for, argue as
we may for one moral code for both sexes, we cannot change nature's
law, which imposes the greater responsibility upon the mother of
the unborn child; the child she carries so many months beneath her
heart, giving it hour by hour the impression of her mental and
physical conditions.
<p>Fathers ought not to smoke or indulge in other bad habits.
<p><i>Mothers must not</i>.
<p>I hope in time to discuss these topics with Wanda, and to make
an impression upon her mind by my arguments.
<p>But your methods and mine, dear Jane, differ widely. And,
begging your pardon, I believe mine accomplish more good for a
larger number of human beings than yours.
<p>And, added to that fact, I get more happiness for myself out of
life.
<p>Miss Ordosky would have managed to smoke her cigarette, however
rigid had I been in expressing my principles. And she would have
found some excuse to shorten her visit under my roof, and then
where would be my opportunity to influence her?
<p>As it is, she puffs her cigarette in my company, listens to my
opinions, seems to respect my ideas, and is interested in my views
of life. We are becoming excellent comrades, and this is far more
gratifying to me than to know that I had antagonized her into a
formal acquaintance by my aggressive morality. I have an idea that,
before my pretty guest reaches the time when she will consider
wifehood and motherhood as life professions, I may convince her
from a scientific standpoint that she better abandon her
cigarettes. And to convince one's mind is far better than to drive
one to submission.
<p>And now, Jane, has it never occurred to you that you have made
some mistakes in life by the very methods you are so sorry I did
not pursue with Miss Ordosky?
<p>Years ago, I recall your surrounding a certain young man with an
aureole of idealism. Then you were obliged to dethrone him from his
pedestal because he, too, forsooth, smoked a cigar.
<p>That young man married a woman quite as worthy and good as
yourself, and he has made the best of husbands and citizens. I know
of no man who does more good in the world in a quiet way than this
same unpedestaled old admirer of yours. Whether he still smokes his
cigar or not I could not say. But as a man, it seems to me, he is
quite as worthy and noble a citizen, as you are a woman.
<p>I know that you are doing all you can, to spread the gospel of
clean living abroad in the land, and that your influence is all for
a higher standard of morality.
<p>But if you live on too high an altitude, in this world, and
refuse to associate with any one who will not climb up to your
plane, you are destined to a lonely life, and your sphere of
influence is limited. You will do far more good by taking your
place with other human beings, and by gradual, sane efforts leading
the thoughts of your associates to turn to your wholesome ideas of
life. You are making morality unpopular by your present aggressive
methods. And you are missing many sweet friendships and experiences
by your insistence that all your friends must follow the narrow
path you have decided is the only road to good behaviour.
<p>Come down from your pedestal, my dear Jane&mdash;come and dwell on the
earth.
<p>THE END.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a

the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year. For example:

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
